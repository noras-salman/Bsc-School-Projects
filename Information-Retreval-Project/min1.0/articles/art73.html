<b>Nissan Announces Pricing on All-New Second Generation 2005 Xterra SUV</b><br><p>&nbsp;by: <b>Jenny McLane</b><p><p><p><p>Last Feb. 9, 2005, Nissan North America, Inc. announced pricing on the revolutionary 2005 Nissan Xterra SUV.  The all-new 2005 Xterra offers improvements on virtually all functional and user attributes with more power, more roominess and more features, including enhanced off-road performance systems.<p><p>The 2005 Xterra will be offered in three trim levels – S, Off-Road and SE.  Each model comes with a standard 4.0-liter 265-horsepower V6 and is offered in both 2WD and 4WD.  Starting Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the Xterra S 2WD M/T is $20,800.  The Xterra Off-Road model with 4WD M/T features a MSRP of 25,500, while the SE 2WD A/T features a MSRP of $25,300.<p><p>Complete pricing and option packages are available on the attached sheets.<p><p>The 2005 Nissan Xterra continues the theme of the original – everything you need, nothing you don’t.  But now truer than ever,   The enhancements for the second generation Xterra, all in keeping with the spirit of the first, include a redesigned interior and exterior, new engine and platform. <p><p>The new Xterra utilizes a modified version of the F-Alpha platform, developed for the full-size Nissan Armada and full-size Nissan Titan pickup, tailored to suit this application.  For its use in Xterra, the platform utilizes an independent double-wishbone front and solid axle leaf spring rear suspension, standard 4.0-liter DOHC V6 rated at 265 horsepower and 284 lb-ft of torque, and a choice of 5-speed automatic or 6-speed manual transmissions. <p><p>The 2005 Xterra is offered with an available enhanced off-road system.  The part-time 4WD system includes 2WD/4HI/4LO modes and electronically controlled transfer case.  A Vehicle Dynamic Control (VDC) system is also available, along with other advanced off-road capabilities.<p><p>Xterra’s new exterior styling evokes that of the original, including a highly functional roof rack (now with covered gear box).  Inside, the 2005 Xterra offers more room, especially in 2nd row head room and leg room, and enhanced utility of the multi-flex cargo area – including an Easy Clean Cargo Area and a Utili-Track channel system in the cargo floor.<p><p>“When Xterra debuted in 1999, it truly set the mark in terms of its combination of outstanding purposeful unique styling matched with practical size and functionality,” said Mark McNabb, vice president and general manager, Nissan Division.  “The all-new Xterra follows this path with an even more capable, more powerful and truly authentic SUV built specifically for the needs of the core outdoor enthusiast.”<p><p>In North America, Nissan's operations include automotive styling, engineering, consumer and corporate financing, sales and marketing, distribution and manufacturing.
