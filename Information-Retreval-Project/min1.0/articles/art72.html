<b>2006 Chevrolet Corvette Z06</b><br><p>&nbsp;by: <b>Stuart Simpson</b><p><p><p><p>What’s new for the 2006 Corvette Z06?<p><p>First, the 2006 Chevrolet Corvette has been redesigned for the 2006-year model.  It has enhanced features, but in this article I want to tell you specifically about the Z06 features to this model.<p><p>The Z06 is, of course, the fastest vette ever built.  It will have a 500 horsepower 427 cubic inch engine with lightweight components.  What does this mean in a 3130-pound car?  It means superior performance beyond all other Corvettes.  Estimated 0-60 in less than 4 seconds along with a sub 12-second quarter mile.  Top speed is reported to be more than 190 MPH (on a closed race track of course).<p><p>What makes this new Corvette so much better?  Several components:<p><ol><p>	<li>500-hp/475 lb.-ft torque<p>	<li>7000 RPM redline<p>	<li>11.0:1 Compression<p>	<li>Titanium connecting rods<p>	<li>Titanium intake valves and pushrods<p>	<li>Hand built engine<p>	<li>Dry sump lubrication<p>	<li>Aluminum body structure<p>	<li>Carbon fiber front fenders<p>	<li>Magnesium front cradle<p>	<li>Fixed roof design for rigidity<p>	<li>Larger grill and cold air intake scoop<p>	<li>Wide rear fenders and a rear spoiler incorporated into the tail of the car<p>	<li>Larger cross-drilled front and rear disc brakes<p>	<li>Larger wheels and tires<p>	<li>3” exhaust<p>	<li>Light weight seats with fixed side bolsters<p></ol><p><p>Options:<p><ol><p>	<li>Bose audio with an in dash six CD changer<p>	<li>Polished wheels<p>	<li>Telescoping steering wheel<p>	<li>Heated seats<p>	<li>Navigation system<p>	<li>Homelink<p>	<li>XM Satellite Radio<p></ol><p><p>All in all, this is going to be one of the best Corvettes Chevrolet has ever offered.
