<b>OEM Supply Arrangement for Mini-Vehicles between Nissan and Mitsubishi Increased</b><br><p>&nbsp;by: <b>Jenny McLane</b><p><p><p><p>Mini-vehicles are fast becoming popular especially among the youthful sectors. Not only is it aesthetically pleasing, it is also practical and a great space-saver. In this light, two of the world's top auto manufacturers have beefed up their production and supply agreement of Mini vehicles.<p><p>Nissan and Mitsubishi have agreed to expand their OEM supply arrangement for Mini-Vehicles. Under this new agreement, Mitsubishi would supply Nissan with an additional mini-vehicle on an OEM basis starting in the first half of fiscal year 2005. With this, the annual mini-vehicle supply from Mitsubishi to Nissan will increase more than two-fold from 20.000 units at present to 56,000 units. <p><p>Specifically, Mitsubishi will supply Nissan with a total of 36.000 eK series mini-passenger cars. This is in addition to the 20,000 Minicab mini-commercial vehicles it currently supplies. The Minicab, featuring both a truck and van version, has been one of Nissan's products. Nissan has been selling this model under the Clipper name since October 2003. This time, two variations of the EK series will be supplied by Mitsubishi, the eK Wagon and eK Sport.<p><p>With the new eK, Nissan will now have three mini-vehicles in its product lineup. Nissan also sells the Moco mini-passenger car. These three models will broaden the company's customer base. Mitsubishi has supplied a total of 33,300 Minicabs between October 2003 and December 2004. <p><p>Mitsubishi and Nissan evidently anticipate more buyers of its mini-passenger cars.
