<b>How To Plan A Car Show Attraction</b><br><p>&nbsp;by: <b>Tonza Borden</b><p><p><p><p>Antique classic cars, especially collector and specialty automobiles are a hot attraction for any event—whether indoor or outdoor. How do you get the cars to display? If you are a classic car club, members are happy to participate with their vintage rides. Another option is contributing a donation to a nonprofit car club for their service.<p><p>Main Attraction<p><p>These beautiful motorcars are show quality. So having a contact with a car club is essential. Individual clubs have different rules and regulations for displaying cars. If you are planning a classic car attraction, you should contact the car club as soon as you decide that you want to have a car show. Time is of the essence to work out the details, and get on their calendar, in the car show season. Prepare questions prior to making the call to appear organized and save time. Some frequently asked questions are:<p><ul><p>	<li>What is the donation amount for your service?<p>	<li>How long can the cars be exhibited?<p>	<li>How many cars will you bring?<p></ul><p><p>A car show requires a large venue with sections for exhibitors, vendors and visitors parking. Overall, you will need an area big enough for everyone’s ease of movement and equipment storage.<p><p>Sub-Attractions<p><p>Some car show events feature the main attraction, which are the classic cars without considering sub-attractions such as:<p><ul><p>	<li>Disc Jockey and musicians<p>	<li>Food and beverage vendors<p>	<li>Swap meet exhibitors<p>	<li>Children’s activities<p></ul><p><p>Just think about it. A car show with just a main attraction could possibly be boring. A great attraction is built with layers such as automobiles for visual, food for smell, music for sound, and games for interactivity to stimulate visitors—all of which contribute to having a good time—and will make your car show much more attractive.<p><p><p><p><p><table width=100% cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 border=0 bgcolor=#dddddd><p><tr><td><p><p><b>About The Author</b><br><p><p><p>Tonza Borden is the developer and administrator of <a href="http://AtlantaAntiqueCarClub.com" target=new>AtlantaAntiqueCarClub.com</a>.
