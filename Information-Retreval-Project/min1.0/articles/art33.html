<b>All About Car Shows:  How To Pick A Leader</b><br><p>&nbsp;by: <b>Tonza Borden</b><p><p><p><p>Who’s In Charge Here?<p><p>That is what your organization needs to decide upfront.  The person who organizes and directs the show determines whether you have a good or great car show.  And guess what, you’re it!<p><p>Or, this should mainly be a person who is good at coordinating multiple tasks and directing the work of other people.  Planning a car show does not have to be difficult.  You can actually experience a good time, if you pick a natural leader.<p><p>This would most likely be someone who enjoys managing people and has an even temper when things go wrong.  According to Murphy’s Law, things will go wrong.  Even if you don’t believe that if anything can go wrong it will, something will not go the way you planned it.<p><p>The Right Stuff<p><p>Put the right person in charge to ensure that everything is carried out according to plan.  It is equally important that it be someone whom sponsors and vendors can relate to as well.  Since the next logical step is to form committees, the lead person must be well liked and respected.  Selecting an event director should not be ignored nor taken lightly.  The structure and success of the car show requires it.<p><p>Avoid Chaos<p><p>Don’t expect to let the group lead because you will have a mass of confusion.  The plan should be discussed with the group to get their input and to finalize the plan.<p><p>Usually, the person whose idea it is to have a car show becomes the leader.  They either already know how to execute a show or needs to consult articles such as this to get started.<p><p>Pick the best person to keep it all together and represent the organization and car show.  If you put the right person in charge and give them a good plan to follow, you are half way to a great car show.  It is now time to form committees.<p><p><p><p><p><table width=100% cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 border=0 bgcolor=#dddddd><p><tr><td><p><p><b>About The Author</b><br><p><p><p>Tonza Borden is the developer and administrator of <a href="http://AtlantaAntiqueCarClub.com" target=new>AtlantaAntiqueCarClub.com</a>.
