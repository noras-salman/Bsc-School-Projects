<b>iPod Integration for Mercedes-Benz, Volvo in 2005</b><br><p>&nbsp;by: <b>Jenny McLane</b><p><p><p><p>“Almost every car company in the world is working to integrate iPod into their cars in 2005,” said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing. “iPod customers want to take their entire music collection with them everywhere they go, including their car, so we’re excited to be able to work with so many leading automotive companies to provide customers with integrated solutions.” <p><p>Volvo and Apple announced in January two iPod connectivity options for Volvo's entire 2005 US model line, allowing iPod users to listen to their music collection through their Volvo audio system. Mercedes-Benz USA also annouced an iPod Integration Kit for Mercedes-Benz, offering full iPod music navigation through the Mercedes-Benz audio system as well as the ability to select music using artist, album or playlist with the multifunction controls on the steering wheel and the integrated multifunction display on their instrument cluster. <p><p>iPod is the world’s most popular family of digital music players and the best way for Mac® or PC users to listen to music at home, on-the-go and in the car. Apple is working with leaders in the automotive industry to provide the best experience through car stereo systems, as the automobile is a perfect place for iPod users to listen to their music. <p><p>The iPod Integration Kit for Mercedes-Benz will debut this April in the US ($300 plus installation) with the newly redesigned 2006 Mercedes-Benz M-Class, and for most other 2005 and 2006 models later this year. Mercedes-Benz is the first automaker to provide full iPod music navigation for drivers to listen to their entire iPod music collection through the Mercedes-Benz audio system, as well as select their music using artist, album or playlist with the multifunction controls on the steering wheel and the integrated multifunction display on their instrument cluster. <p><p>Volvo’s two iPod connectivity options for their entire 2005 US model line allow iPod users to listen to their entire music collection through their Volvo audio system. The Volvo iPod Adapter will be available for S60, S80 and V70/XC70 models and will connect by simply plugging the iPod into a cable located in the car’s glove compartment, while S40, V50 and XC90 owners can use a dashboard mounted FM transmitter. The Volvo iPod Adapter allows users to control their music through their Volvo sound system and steering wheel controls, and both options charge the iPod when plugged in. <p><p>The Volvo iPod Adapter pricing will be announced at program launch in the second quarter of 2005 for all Volvo models. Authorized Volvo dealers perform installation only. The Volvo iPod Adapter works with all iPods with a dock connector.<p><p>For all of your Mercedes Benz Parts needs welcome to the Online Directory for Mercedes Parts, Mercedes Benz Parts and Mercedes Accessories on the Internet.<p><p>Search online for the latest Mercedes-Benz breakthroughs and technological parts, accessories & products at <a href="http://www.partstrain.com/ShopByVehicle/MERCEDES_BENZ" target=new>http://www.partstrain.com/ShopByVehicle/MERCEDES_BENZ</a> and you're on your way to a satisfying your Mercedes-Benz car parts needs.<p><p><p><p><p><table width=100% cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 border=0 bgcolor=#dddddd><p><tr><td><p><p><b>About The Author</b><br><p><p><p>Jenny McLane is a 36 year old native of Iowa and has a knack for research on cars and anything and everything about it.
