<b>Keeping Used Motorcycle Parts As Good As New</b><br><p>&nbsp;by: <b>Granny's Mettle</b><p><p><p><p>Even with regular maintenance and upkeep, our motorcycles tend to get used and subjected to different elements in the environment. To keep used motorcycle parts as good as the day when we first bought them, regular washing and rinsing will do the trick. <p><p>But you should take note how you do your washing. You might scratch parts of your motorcycle.<p><p>Top Rule: Avoid scratches.<p><p>Scratches are the biggest enemy of any bike's finish. The secret of keeping your used motorcycle parts as good as new is to avoid scratches in your motorcycle. Dirt and grime when rubbed in while washing or drying, act as sandpaper and will definitely dull the brilliance of your bike's paint. <p><p>To avoid scratching your bike, first, you need to remember that anything that comes in contact with your motorcycle's finish should be made of soft material. Take care that no harsh or rough surfaces will be able to connect with any part of your motorcycle. Zippers are the worst offenders.<p><p>Use only clean, freshly washed cotton cloths or towels to dry your bike after washing. When you need to put on any application to make your bike shine, again use the clean cotton cloths and towels. Rinse thoroughly the sponges or wash mitts, as well as the bucket, before and after washing your bike to remove any dirt or grime. <p><p>One of the best advice I got from a used motorcycle parts site was to separate my bike's areas into normal and rough areas when washing. I usually consider the painted surfaces as normal areas, while the tires, engine, and inner fenders are the rough areas. I use different wash mitts and sponges for each area to keep dirt and grime away from the sensitive areas. This way, scratching would be avoided.<p><p>Use also a gentle stream of water when rinsing, rather than high water pressure that comes from the hose. The high pressure of water will cause dirt to grind further into the paint, causing scratches along with other worse problems. And remember to use generous amounts of water when rinsing. Dirt that causes scratch will easily float away with enough water used. <p><p>When washing your bike…<p><p>Use lots of water, but without the high pressure. Totally avoid using pressure washers. Instead let the water flow freely by detaching the nozzle from the hose. <p><p>Along with the generous amount of water, use detergents designed specifically for motorcycle washing. Ordinary detergent tends to remove the wax that we want to try to keep. Simply mix the detergent according to the directions and go for it. Just make sure you rinse each section soon after applying the detergent so that no soap film will develop. It is difficult to get rid of the soap film when it dries up.<p><p>After washing, rinse, rinse, and rinse some more. Rinse everywhere. Every nook and cranny should be rinsed of soap. <p><p>Lastly, wash your motorcycle without bright sunlight. Soap suds can easily dry from the heat. Ideal time of the day would be in the late afternoon or early morning when the sun is not so strong. <p><p><p><p><p><table width=100% cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 border=0 bgcolor=#dddddd><p><tr><td><p><p><b>About The Author</b><br><p><p><p>Granny's Mettle is a 30-something, professional web content writer.
