<b>10 Steps to Choosing the Right Vehicle</b><br><p>&nbsp;by: <b>Robert Arthur</b><p><p><p><p>Step #1 : What Kind of Vehicle Do You Need?<p><p>Answer the following questions to help decide which kind of vehicle is right for you:<p><p>How many people will you be transporting?<p><br>How long is your commute?<p><br>What kind of gas mileage do you expect?<p><br>What conditions will you be driving in?<p><br>Which safety features do you want?<p><br>What size of vehicle do you want?<p><br>Do you want an automatic or manual transmission?<p><p>Step #2 : How Much Can You Afford to Spend?<p><p>In order to distinguish the range of vehicles, you must decide how much you can afford to spend. Remember to take into consideration additional costs such as title, tax, registration, insurance, and additional costs. In most cases when you are going to finance the vehicle, it is best to get preapproved so that you will know how much you can spend. Other questions to ask yourself are:<p><p>How much can you put down as a down payment?<p><br>How much can you afford to pay in monthly payments?<p><p>Step #3 : Will You Buy the Vehicle or Lease It?<p><p>Deciding on whether to buy or lease your vehicle is an important decision. If you plan on keeping the vehicle once it is paid off, then you will want to buy the vehicle. On the other hand, if you just wish to drive the vehicle and not obtain ownership, then you may want to just lease the vehicle. Normally the price for leasing a vehicle is considerably less than purchasing the vehicle, since you are just leasing the right to drive it.<p><p>Step #4 : Decide on Which Vehicles You Wish to Consider<p><p>This is the time when you want to pick out the makes and models of the vehicles you are considering. By answering the questions listed in step #1, you should have some idea of which vehicles you wish to consider.<p><p>Step #5 : Find the Vehicles<p><p>Visit <a href="http://www.autopixal.com/buy/" target=new>http://www.autopixal.com/buy/</a> and find the vehicles you are interested in. Be sure to select the correct distance, price, and year of the vehicles you are interested in.<p><p>Step #6 : Research the Vehicles<p><p>Compare the prices of similar vehicles. Use our website to find other vehicles that may not be within the distance you selected, but have the same options you selected. Use the articles under the research section to find additional information to help assist you in your decision.<p><p>Step #7 : Find the Market Value of the Vehicles<p><p>Use the market value tools at <a href="http://www.autopixal.com/research/vehiclevalue/" target=new>http://www.autopixal.com/research/vehiclevalue/</a> to find the market value of the vehicles you are considering. By finding the market value, you can use that to your advantage in negotiating the price.<p><p>Step #8 : Schedule a Test Drive<p><p>Contact the seller and schedule a test drive. When taking the vehicle for a test drive, be sure to take the vehicle into different driving conditions. The Interstate or Downtown are two places in which you may want to drive the vehicle. Also be sure to listen for vibrations or noises caused by the vehicle while driving.<p><p>Step #9 : Negotiate the Price<p><p>Inspect the vehicle to see if you can find any additional elements that you can use in your negotiations. Small problems can serve to your advantage when they are presented. Take into consideration any problems you may have found while driving or inspecting the vehicle, and the market value of the vehicle when deciding on a price. Don't jump the gun with your offer. Give the seller time to consider the fact that you may not be too interested in the vehicle and the seller may lower the price in hopes of closing the deal.<p><p>Step #10 : Close the Deal<p><p>Find out any information you may need to know about the vehicle from the seller. Contact your insurance provider, or use the Insurance section of our website, along with the Vin# from the vehicle in order to obtain insurance for your vehicle. Then transfer the title and register the vehicle in your name. Depending on your state's laws, the requirements for buying a vehicle may vary. Contact your local DMV for additional information.<p><p><p><p><p><table width=100% cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 border=0 bgcolor=#dddddd><p><tr><td><p><p><b>About The Author</b><br><p><p><p>Rob Arthur is the lead developer for <a href="http://AutoPixal.com" target=new>AutoPixal.com</a>, which is a site that offers free classified ads for buying and selling vehicles.
