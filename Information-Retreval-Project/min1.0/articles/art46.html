<b>Presidential Limousine Introduces New 2006 Cadillac DTS</b><br><p>&nbsp;by: <b>Jenny McLane</b><p><p><p><p>Contemporary design cues and bold styling statement are viewed by the public for the first time as George W. Bush, the President of the United States of America traveled in the new jet-black state of the art Cadillac DTS limousine during the parade route along Pennsylvania Avenue during the Presidential Inaugural Parade. The sight of the president waving from a Cadillac has become an American tradition. <p><p>"We are pleased that our historic relationship with the U.S. government and chief executive office has continued through the years " said General Motors Chairman and CEO Rick Wagoner. <p><p>The new Cadillac DTS limousine is handcrafted and dressed in a jet-black clear coat finish. The vehicle is a considerably longer, wider and taller version of the production model that becomes available later this year. To maintain national security, the limousines are equipped with state-of-the-art protection and communication systems. <p><p>The limousine makes a bold styling statement similar to the new 2006 Cadillac DTS by incorporating Cadillac's contemporary design cues to the front and rear portions of the vehicle. Redesigned front and rear fascias integrate Cadillac's signature egg-crate grille with center-mounted wreath and crest badge, jewel-like vertically oriented high-intensity xenon headlamps and state-of-the-art LED tail lamps. <p><p>Comfort and visibility for all six occupants, the limo boasts of   rear seat executive package which features a concealed, foldaway desktop that can be deployed when conducting affairs of state. The rear seats have an adjustable reclining feature along with the adaptive seat system, which senses the position of the occupant in the seat and automatically adjusts the cushion for added comfort. Rear seat passengers can enjoy their own premium sound system complete with a 10-disc CD changer. Wood accents, rich blue leather and cloth complete the executive interior. <p><p>An embroidered presidential seal is positioned in the center of the rear seat back panel, as well as on each rear door trim panel. Presidential seals are also affixed to the exterior rear doors. The U.S. flag is placed on the right front fender, and the presidential standard is located on the left front fender when the president travels in the vehicle. Flush-mounted High Intensity Discharged (HID) spotlights illuminate the flags at night. <p><p>From its Cadillac-signature styling to its power and refined ride characteristics, the DTS is a product of unwavering attention to detail which builds on the strengths and appeal of the Cadillac brand. The 2006 Cadillac DTS production model is set to make its first public appearance at the Chicago Auto Show in early February. <p><p>Expected to go on sale in the third quarter of 2005, the new Cadillac DTS marks the ninth new vehicle introduced into the Cadillac portfolio since 2001 and aligns with Cadillac's alpha naming strategy established by the CTS, SRX, XLR and STS vehicles. Evolving from three models - DeVille, DHS and DTS - with exterior and interior differentiation, the DTS will incorporate a single-model strategy with one exterior and various option packages. <p><p>The premier luxury division of General Motors Corp. (NYSE: GM), Cadillac produces bold, standout vehicles such as the all-new STS performance sedan, the XLR convertible roadster, the SRX midsize utility, and the CTS entry-level sedan. In addition to selling the popular DeVille nameplate, Cadillac also manufactures the world's most powerful line-up of SUVs, the Escalade, Escalade ESV and Escalade EXT. <p><p>Meanwhile a superb online store Partstrain is dedicated to providing you with genuine Cadillac parts.
