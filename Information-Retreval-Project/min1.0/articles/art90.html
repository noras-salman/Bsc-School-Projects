<b>The 2005 GMC Savana 1500 Series Scores a Big Triumph, Earning Top Safety Ratings in Federal Frontal Crash Test</b><br><p>&nbsp;by: <b>Jenny McLane</b><p><p><p><p>The GMC Savana is a very useful van that can either be used for business or for passenger. It has been known as a work horse and its safety has always been very impressive and remarkable. With all the features and parts you can put in it, the Savana is very functional. Garnering  the highest rating in Federal Front Crash Test, the Savana continues to uphold its legacy of being a safe and durable van. These tests are conducted by the NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) to determine which vehicles are road worthy and safe.<p><p>General Motors Corporation is the world's largest vehicle manufacturer; they employ 325,000 people globally in its core automotive business and subsidiaries. Founded in 1908, GM has been the global automotive sales leader since 1931. GM today has manufacturing operations in 32 countries and its vehicles are sold in more than 190 countries. GM's global headquarters is at the GM Renaissance Center in Detroit.<p><p>"The GMC Savana was designed and built with safety as a priority," said Ray Chess, vehicle line executive for full-size vans. "The Savana is equipped with segment-leading features that enhance both safety and security for our customers." <p><p>The rating is part of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's New Car Assessment Program (NCAP). In this frontal impact test, vehicles are crashed into a fixed barrier at 35 miles per hour, equivalent to a head-on collision between two similar vehicles each moving at 35 mph. A five-star rating ranks the likelihood of serious injury in a 35-mph frontal crash at 10 percent or less. For this NCAP test, NHTSA crashed a 1500 Series (1/2-ton), 8-passenger, two-wheel-drive GMC Savana.<p><p>Initially introduced in 1965, GMC's full-size van has since undergone only one complete redesign. Constant improvements throughout the '70s, '80s and '90s kept it somewhat up to date, but not until a full redesign in 1995 did the Savana become a legitimately modern vehicle. A new exterior look, new engines, extended body styles and improved ergonomics made the previous Savana hard to overlook when compared with the aging Econoline from Ford. The latest version incorporates some significant improvements like electronic stability control and powerful V8 engines that make the Savana safer and more capable than ever before. The Savana delivers a host of safety features, including trade-leading safety firsts such as standard electronic stability on all one-ton passenger vans, available all-wheel drive; and the available OnStar safety and security system on passenger and conversion models. The extended version Express and the Savana vans also feature the longest wheelbases in the !<p><p>business, which further enhance stability. <p><p>The 2005 GMC Savana vans offer a choice of three power plants and all-wheel drive. The standard engine on two-wheel-drive half-ton models is a 4.3-liter V6 rated at 195 horsepower and 260 pound-feet of torque. A 5.3-liter V8 with 295 hp and 325 lb-ft of torque is standard on all-wheel-drive half-tons and optional on two-wheel-drive versions. Three-quarter- and one-ton models come standard with a 6.0-liter V8 rated at 300 hp and 360 lb-ft of torque.<p><p>The 2005 Savana provides the room you need with the comfort you want. Whether you're looking for a passenger or a conversion van, Savana is equipped with an optional driver-side 60/40 swing out door, available all-wheel drive and seating for up to 15 people.
