<b>How to install Neon & LED Undercar lights</b><br><p>&nbsp;by: <b>Antonio Gabellone</b><p><p><p><p>So you've got your Neon or LED under car kit, and can't wait to have it installed and running... am I right? No problemo, we'll have you up and running in no time! <p><p>Just in case you're wondering about how to install other neon or led lights sold at "out-lets" other then the All-Neon-Car-Lights.com website, I can assure you that  most of the instructions that come with each of the various kits are easy to follow. They have been designed with the do-it-yourselfer in mind. (Or at least they "should" be). However, if you are in need of any special advise about a particular car lighting product, please contact us via the email link provided below and we will do our best to help you. <p><p>For some people, a car is a means of transport and nothing more. As long as their vehicle gets them from point A to point B and back again, has nice comfortable seats, a good sound system and a coffee mug holder, it serves all of its purposes well. And of course there are other drivers for which a car is much, much more -- It can be an extension of their personality or an object of their fixation. In this huge world of automotive accessories, there is no product that screams louder than the underbody light kit for this type of individual. If you consider cruising in your car is among your favorite hobbies and you relish the stares of pedestrians and fellow-motorists, then a under car light kit may be for you. <p><p>These lights, which mount to the body around the perimeter of the vehicle's undercarriage, come in kits that contain the elements you'll need for installation. The "how to install under car lights" instructions that you'll be directed to shortly, are fairly straight forward, but since it requires drilling into the body of the vehicle and substantial electrical work (depending on the kit you buy), it's best left to the more experienced do-it-yourselfers. If this project seems a little too hard for you, rest assured that there is a growing number of custom shops that perform this type of installation. If you do decide to take on the installation yourself, which anyone can do with the correct instructions, be sure to purchase a kit that is compatible with your vehicle, and read and follow the instructions that come with the kit carefully. <p><p>Ever wondered how long car lighting kits have been around? Well Hot Rods were the first cars to have undercar lighting installed on them, (although, the lights were nothing like they are today) back before import and export was a big industry world wide. And today, thanks to the World Wide Web and the fact that import and export is now more commonly practiced throughout the world, they have become more popular then ever before.<p><p>So this is the reason why we set out to write up these "How to install under car lights" instructions, as they are *required* by people like yourself.<p><p>Our team of dedicated Market & Product Researchers and including myself, have spent an enormous amount of time & money installing under car kits from a variety of manufacturers, and as a result after all this testing, we can now provide you with generic instructions on how to install under car lights on your vehicle. We also found after this extensive testing was carried out, that Plasmaglow had the best, "all round" car lighting products available on the market today, outlasting and out-performing the competition in every aspect, hence the reason why we recommend their products on the all-neon-car-lights.com website. <p><p>As a related note, please keep in mind that the main issues we face with having neon or LED car lights on our vehicles these days is the fact that they are often frowned upon by the authorities. So to avoid any uninvited fines, its best to install neon lights under a car so as they can be activated through a separate switch rather than having them come on when the headlights are turned on. To do this, you can run a power wire directly from the car battery to the kits operating switch, thus by-passing the vehicles headlight wires. <p><p>The "How to install under car lights" instructions below have been designed & written with ALL "under car kits" in mind. These instructions will benefit those who have LED under car kits to install, and/or Neon under car kits. <p><p>Enjoy your new undercar lights, and drive safely.<p><p>Kind regards<p><p>Antonio Gabellone<p><p>Please choose the instructions below that suit your needs:<p><p>For LED under car lights installation instructions - visit:<p><br><a href="http://www.all-neon-car-lights.com/how-to-install-led-under-car-lights.html" target=new>www.all-neon-car-lights.com/how-to-install-led-under-car-lights.html</a><p><p><p>For Neon under car lights installation instructions - visit:<p><br><a href="http://www.all-neon-car-lights.com/how-to-install-neon-under-car-lights.html" target=new>www.all-neon-car-lights.com/how-to-install-neon-under-car-lights.html</a><p><p><p><p><p><table width=100% cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 border=0 bgcolor=#dddddd><p><tr><td><p><p><b>About The Author</b><br><p><p><p>Copyright <a href="http://All-Neon-Car-Lights.com" target=new>All-Neon-Car-Lights.com</a> 2005. <p><p>Permission is granted to reprint this article provided you supply a live link to the authors website at; <a href="http://www.all-neon-car-lights.com" target=new>http://www.all-neon-car-lights.com</a><p><p><a href="mailto:Antonio@all-neon-car-lights.com">Antonio@all-neon-car-lights.com</a><p><p><p><p><p></td></tr><p></table>
