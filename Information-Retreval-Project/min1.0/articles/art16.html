<b>Learn How To Properly Check Tire Pressure</b><br><p>&nbsp;by: <b>Jakob Jelling</b><p><p><p><p>Tire pressure is one of the things a car needs to have checked most often. Ideally, you should check them once a month as well as any other time when they might look low. Also, if you are planning a long trip with your car, tire pressure is one of the main things you should check, along with a general checking.<p><p>The first thing you need in order to be able to check your car's tire pressure is a tire pressure gauge. You can acquire one at any car parts store or just use one in a gas station. All gas stations have one, but you should ask if it is functioning well before using it. Some of the gauges you might find in gas stations are old or damaged and therefore the information they would give you would be incorrect, which could even lead you to add more air to the tire than it should have. This way, it is important that you make sure the gauge you will use functions properly. <p><p>In order to be able to evaluate the pressure your tires have, you should learn how much pressure they should ideally have. You might easily learn this since your car's driver side doorjamb will probably have a sticker giving you some guidance related to the tires and their pressure.<p><p>Once you know which the proper pressure for your tires is, you are ready to check them. In order to do this, you must unscrew the caps on the tire air valve and press the tire pressure gauge against it. You should make sure you keep the tire pressure gauge as firmly against the tire valve as not to let air come out from it. <p><p>Once you have the tire pressure gauge connected with the tire valve, the gauge will immediately tell you what the tire pressure is. This will allow you to learn weather the tire needs more air or its air pressure is correct. If it needs more air, you should do it carefully in order not to pass its air limit. And, in case its air pressure is correct, you simply need to disconnect the air pressure gauge from it and screw the valve cap back in its place.<p><p><p><p><p><table width=100% cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 border=0 bgcolor=#dddddd><p><tr><td><p><p><b>About The Author</b><br><p><p><p>Jakob Jelling is the founder of <a href="http://www.autorized.com" target=new>http://www.autorized.com</a>.
