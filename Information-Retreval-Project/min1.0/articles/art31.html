On the day of the show, these worker bees will be at their assigned post in the midst of fun and festivities. However, getting to this point is no easy task. To have a car show extravaganza—not your ordinary event, you will need extraordinary people.<p><p>A Few Good People<p><p>They are a select group of men and women who will work on the committees. These individual groups will be the nucleus of executing a successful event. They must be people who like and respect each other to work as a team. A car show extravaganza requires individual stamina, flexibility and cooperation because each committee will be responsible for a component of the event on a time-line.<p><p>Equal Opportunity<p><p>Each person within the committee will have specific tasks to perform.
