<b>What’s Makes Chevy’s Number 1 Truck Just a Bit More Enticing in 2005</b><br><p>&nbsp;by: <b>Jenny McLane</b><p><p><p><p>Last Year Silverado unveiled a hybrid version and it’s still included in this years all star line up.<p><p>The Silverado pickup truck remains Chevy's best selling vehicle, probably in part because it's available in so many configurations. There's a Silverado to suit just about everyone who wants a full size pickup truck. Versatility is one of the Chevy Silverado’s strongest point.<p><p>A gas-electric hybrid model was introduced in 2004 and remains in the lineup for 2005. A Hybrid Silverado’s offer up to 10-percent better fuel economy; it has a 120-volt electrical power with ground fault detection and accessory powering capabilities with power outlets under the rear seat of the cab and in the pickup bed.<p><p>Don't expect to see a hybrid Silverado at most Chevy dealerships. The trucks are available in limited quantities and are only being sold in six states; this includes California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, Nevada and Florida. <p><p>Some of the Chevy Silverado Configurations available for 2005 are the; choices for bodies are the Regular, Extended or Crew Cab bodies. You can also have a pick of Standard 6.5 foot or extended 8-foot boxes. This can come in Fleetside or Sportside box styles. Available are 1500 half-ton or 2500 three-quarter-ton models in 2WD or 4WD systems.<p><p>There are also choices to be made in engine types. They are the 4300 4.3 L V-6, 4800 4.8L V-8, Two models of the Vortec 5300 5.3L V-8 and the Vortec 6000 6.0L V-8. All Silverados with the Vortec 4300 4.3L V-6, and trucks sold in California with the Vortec 4800 4.8L or Vortec 5300 5.3L V-8, have a catalytic converter system that meets Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (ULEV) standards. Trucks equipped with the Vortec 6000 6.0L V-8 come with a dedicated compressed natural gas (CNG) or bi-fuel system that can run on CNG or gasoline. Light-duty Silverados with the Vortec 5300 5.3L V-8 offer an option that allows owners to operate them on varying blends of ethanol and gasoline, up to a maximum of 85 percent ethanol.<p><p>Payload capacities range from 1,295 pounds to 4,047 pounds for 2500 heavy duty models. Gross Vehicle Weight Ratings range from 6,100 pounds to 9,200 pounds on properly equipped heavy duty versions. GM's Quadrasteer four-wheel steering system is available on 1500 Extended Cab short-box and 2500 Crew Cab Silverado pickups. GM's OnStar system is standard on LT and available on LS light duty models. For the heavy duty trucks, OnStar is standard on Silverado LT Extended Cab and Crew Cab models, and available on 2500 HD and 3500 models.<p><p>It all boils down to one thing. When it comes to hard work, the Chevy Silverado is not shy. It is designed to do one thing and has no qualms in doing so. One good thing is, with every year the Chevy Silverado just keeps getting bigger, stronger and tougher. Plus with the addition of the Hybrid edition you can load up and save up also. Working hard doesn’t mean you have to be a Spartan. Many features that seem to pile up every year for added comfort make life a tad bit easier.<p><p>One thing though, no matter how tough a machine the Silverado is, it is what it is, a machine. Machines have the tendency to wear down with its use, the more usage the more the probability there is that metal fatigue is setting in.
