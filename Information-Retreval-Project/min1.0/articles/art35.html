<b>All About Car Shows: Why You Need Sponsors</b><br><p>&nbsp;by: <b>Tonza Borden</b><p><p><p><p>You might be wondering why you need car show sponsors and who are sponsors. Here’s an example. A sponsor is an individual or corporation who donates free products and services to your event.<p><p>No Free Lunch<p><p>Some sponsors donate money but that is rarely the case. Although you do not have to pay for the incentives they provide, there is no free lunch. Sponsors usually require advertising of their brand in exchange for their assistance. This is only fair since they are saving you a lot of out-of-pocket money.<p><p>Even large car shows take advantage of sponsorships. So it is definitely to your advantage to seek them as well. It could make the difference when there is no money in the budget for prizes and giveaway merchandise.<p><p>Developing a relationship with sponsors has mutual benefits. However, it is recommended that you approach potential sponsors that cater to your event visitors. In this case, they are more likely to respond favorably to your request.<p><p>You Got Homework<p><p>Do your research to determine the type of incentives a sponsor may be willing to contribute before you ask. The merchandise request needs to be related to the event. For example, golf clubs are not related to a car show but a set of tires would get you rolling in the right direction. Be very professional when you contact a potential sponsor. Give them enough lead-time to respond and don’t forget to thank them regardless.<p><p>If you have never solicited a sponsorship, contact people who have—to get ideas about submitting requests, etc. This is an area that requires good written and oral communication skills but don’t let that scare you. Again, ask for volunteers. There is usually someone in the group who can accomplish this task—and you will be glad they did.<p><p><p><p><p><table width=100% cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 border=0 bgcolor=#dddddd><p><tr><td><p><p><b>About The Author</b><br><p><p><p>Tonza Borden is the developer and administrator of <a href="http://AtlantaAntiqueCarClub.com" target=new>AtlantaAntiqueCarClub.com</a>.
