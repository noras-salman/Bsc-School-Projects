<b>Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL)</b><br><p>&nbsp;by: <b>Melih Oztalay</b><p><p><p><p>Drivers 16 years of age are at high risk for traffic accidents due to their immaturity and limited driving experience. A series of five research papers published in a September 2002 supplement of Injury Prevention addresses this risk among young drivers. The papers make a compelling case for graduated driver licensing (GDL), the system of laws and practices that gradually introduce young drivers into the driving population.<p><p>Graduated Driver License programs can be found in 31 states around the country. The GDL program permit young drivers to safely gain driving experience before obtaining full driving privileges and are generally targeted towards 14 – 17 year old teen drivers.<p><p>Most states require an adult with a valid driver’s license be present when the teen is driving. Additionally the teen driver is required to enroll in a certified Drivers Ed course and must hold a learner’s permit for at least 3 – 6 months before taking an “operators driving license” test.<p><p>It is during these 3 – 6 months when teen drivers with learner’s permits mostly drive the family vehicle with their parents. While GDL programs allow the teen driver to gain experience in a family vehicle with a parent, other drivers are not aware who is behind the wheel of this vehicle.<p><p>Notifying other drivers will give them the ability to consider choices when approaching a vehicle operated by a teen driver. We can increase traffic safety and awareness. Car magnets have become a viable possibility as the notification tool. Easy to put on and easy to take off! No hassles or concerns about permanent bumper stickers that may not come off.<p><p>Auto Safety Magnets has a focus strictly on car safety for teen drivers, their parents and driving schools. Help keep the roads safe.<p><p>More information on the GDL subject can be found at the Center for Disease Control and this web page: <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/duip/research/youngdrivers.htm" target=new>http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/duip/research/youngdrivers.htm</a><p><p><p><p><p><table width=100% cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 border=0 bgcolor=#dddddd><p><tr><td><p><p><b>About The Author</b><br><p><p><p>Melih Oztalay, CEO<p><br>Auto Safety Magnets<p><br><a href="http://www.autosafetymagnets.com" target=new>www.autosafetymagnets.com</a><p><br><a href="mailto:melih@autosafetymagnets.com">melih@autosafetymagnets.com</a><p><p><p><p><p></td></tr><p></table>
