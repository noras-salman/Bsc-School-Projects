<b>Mercedes-Benz B-Class: Blends Different Vehicle Concepts Into Versatility</b><br><p>&nbsp;by: <b>Jenny McLane</b><p><p><p><p>Blending different vehicle concepts into one versatile vehicle, Mercedes-Benz announced its new B-Class "Compact Sports Tourer" would have its world premiere at the Geneva International Motor Show in March. <p><p>The B-Class blends different vehicle concepts into one versatile vehicle. One major feature of the B-Class is the sandwich concept developed by Mercedes-Benz. With the space-saving arrangement of the engine and transmission partly in front of and partly beneath the passenger cell, the new B-Class offers the interior spaciousness of larger sedans and wagons despite its compact external dimensions.<p><p>The body has a length of 4270 millimeters, corresponding to the compact car class. Inside, however, the new Mercedes model offers more than other cars of comparable size in this segment in all comfort-related respects, e.g. shoulder-room, legroom and headroom. <p><p>Occupants in the rear benefit from the long wheelbase (2778 millimeters); this allows a distance between seats and generous knee room, which almost matches that in the S-Class. <p><p>The B-Class can be converted from a touring car to a practical van. Depending on the number and position of the seats, the load capacity can be increased from 544 to up to 2245 liters (with rear seats and front passenger seat removed). This corresponds to the load capacity of large wagons. The maximum loading length is 2.95 meters. <p><p>The new Mercedes B-Class Compact Sports Tourer has a height-adjustable load compartment floor, an asymmetrically divided, folding and removable rear seat unit plus an optionally removable front passenger seat.  The new B-Class will go on sale in Europe this summer. <p><p>Search for discount OEM Mercedes Benz parts and Mercedes Benz auto parts from our online store at: <a href="http://www.partstrain.com/ShopByVehicle/MERCEDEZ_BENZ" target=new>http://www.partstrain.com/ShopByVehicle/MERCEDEZ_BENZ</a> Mercedes Benz Parts absolutely the lowest prices and best service available on the net and for the latest Mercedes-Benz breakthroughs and technological parts, accessories & products...<p><p><p><p><p><table width=100% cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 border=0 bgcolor=#dddddd><p><tr><td><p><p><b>About The Author</b><br><p><p><p>Jenny McLane is a 36 year old native of Iowa and has a knack for research on cars and anything and everything about it.
