<b>Dodge eyes Police Car Market with its HEMI?-powered 2006 Dodge Charger</b><br><p>&nbsp;by: <b>Jenny McLane</b><p><p><p><p>Dodge is set to conquer the police car market later this year with its all-new 2006 Dodge Charger police vehicle. A four-door sedan with all the power, handling and functionality required to effectively patrol streets, the 2006 Dodge Charger is perfect for the job. "With rear-wheel drive and available HEMI? power at the pavement, the Dodge Charger provides optimum police car pursuit performance," said Darryl Jackson, Vice President - Dodge Marketing, Chrysler Group. "Dodge has a strong police heritage and is proud to offer vehicles armed with modern muscle and cutting-edge technology". The Dodge Charger police vehicle will join the Dodge Magnum, another Dodge model previously announced to charge into the market. The two models will round out Dodge's growing fleet of bold, powerful and capable vehicles designed for law enforcement agencies.<p><p>"We listened to what law enforcement officers asked for and paid attention to the details that are important to them," said Ray Fisher, Vice President - Sales, Service and Parts Operations, Chrysler Group. "By integrating features and functionality into the original design of the Dodge Charger, we can give our police customers an affordable, capable vehicle with industry-leading innovations."<p><p>The Dodge Charger police vehicle will be available with a 5.7-liter HEMI V-8 engine that produces 340 Horsepower at 5000 rpm and 390 lbs.-ft. of torque at 4000 rpm. The V-8 HEMI engine also features Chrysler Group's Multi-Displacement System (MDS). This system effortlessly alternates between smooth, high economy four-cylinder mode when less power is needed and V-8 mode when more power is required. With the MDS in place fuel efficiency is also improved by up to 20 percent without compromising performance. The HEMI engines will also allow the Dodge Charger police vehicle to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in just 6.0 seconds. <p><p>Meanwhile, the Dodge Charger is also available with a powerful 3.5 liter High Output V-6 engine hat provides 250 horsepower at 6400 rpm and 250 lbs.-ft. of torque at 3800 rpm. Other excellent features include a fully electronic five-speed automatic transmission with an Electronically Modulated Converter Clutch offering improved shift feel to match a variety of driving styles, situations and road conditions. This will prove to be very useful in police operations throughout the country. This transmission is standard in all Dodge Charger police cars. Meanwhile, tough brakes and linings will provide a secure and stable deceleration and braking capability.<p><p>With these two models, Dodge will once again dominate the police car market which it lorded over in the 1960s, 70s and 80s. During that period, the former Chrysler Corporation had a market share of 45-60 percent in the US. Some of the police vehicles manufactured by the former Chrysler Corporation include Dodge Monaco, Dodge Royal Monaco, Dodge Coronet, Dodge Diplomat, Dodge Dart, Dodge St. Regis, Plymouth Fury, Plymouth Gran Fury, Plymouth Volare and Chrysler Newport. <p><p>Dodge, Chrysler's best selling brand, currently enjoys a US market share of seven percent, making it the fifth largest nameplate in the US automotive market. Dodge also continues to lead the minivan market with a 20 percent share of the market. Meanwhile, when it comes to Dodge auto parts, one of the leading online suppliers is Auto Parts Train.
