The 2004 Acura TL was the first car in the U.S. to include an OEM car audio system with DTS as standard. <p><p>Major after-market car audio manufacturers today produce systems featuring DTS decoders, including Alpine, Clarion, Eclipse, JVC, Kenwood, Panasonic, Pioneer, Sanyo and Sony. <p><p>DTS is an innovator in the development of multi-channel digital sound solutions for the consumer electronics and professional audio markets, including home A/V, video games and consoles, broadcast, personal computers and mobile and portable audio systems. Today, every major consumer electronics manufacturer supports DTS technology. Addressing the demand for DTS-encoded content worldwide, DTS also offers hardware and software encoders to the professional audio communities, allowing them to produce DTS audio content directly. <p><p>"The automotive industry recognizes how surround sound enhances the entertainment experience in the car, and we will see more and more manufacturers following Acura, Cadillac and Land Rover's lead in introducing entertainment systems featuring DTS and surround sound into their new vehicle models." <p><p>"The car is an ideal environment to experience the enveloping nature of surround sound.
