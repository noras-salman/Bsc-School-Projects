<b>Chevrolet  Ranks As America's Top-Selling Certified Used Vehicle</b><br><p>&nbsp;by: <b>Jenny McLane</b><p><p><p><p>Chevrolet is now the top-selling certified used vehicle in America. This announcement is based on Autodata Corp.'s October 2004 data for single-line make certified used vehicle sales. With record monthly sales of 40,666 units in October of last year, Chevrolet overtook Toyota to become America's best selling certified used vehicle manufacturer. This is according to Jeff Heichel, the director of GM Used Vehicle Activities. <p><p>According to the Autodata U.S. Certified Pre-Owned Vehicle Retail Sales - October 2004 summary report, GM Certified Used Vehicles - which includes Chevrolet, Pontiac, Buick, GMC and Oldsmobile models - has sold 218,451 Chevrolet certified units through October 2004, exceeding by 26,240 the 192,211 certified units sold during the same period by Toyota, the previous category leader in single-line make certified used vehicle sales<p><p>A certified used vehicle is becoming a popular alternative to higher priced brand new cars. For less money, a buyer can afford a car that feels "brand-new" even though the odometer is showing 20,000 to 30,000 miles. More importantly, by choosing a certified used vehicle the buyer is assured that the major drawbacks that people encounter in used cars, namely:  uncertainty about the mechanical condition of the vehicle, is ruled out. This is because certified used vehicles have already been thoroughly inspected by a mechanic. Anything that was wrong, or about to go wrong, has been repaired.<p><p>"Chevrolet's position as the top-selling single-line make certified used vehicle brand is a strong testament to the excellent value offered by Chevrolet cars and trucks and the active engagement of the GM Certified dealer network," said Heichel. "Certified GM sales across all brands have increased more than tenfold in the last four years, as our dealers provide customers a positive purchase and ownership experience and the peace of mind that comes from buying fully inspected and reconditioned vehicles from the GM brands they trust."<p><p>Through October 2004, market share for all of GM's certified brands, including GM Certified Used Vehicles, Cadillac Certified Pre-Owned, Used Cars from Saturn and Saab Certified Pre-Owned, is 33.5 percent, up 1.7 points year-to-date from the same period in 2003, with GM Certified Used Vehicles posting a 28.1 percent share through October, up 1.5 points.<p><p>Chevrolet comprises approximately 60 percent of all GM Certified Used Vehicles sold, with the Chevrolet Silverado ranking as the top-selling GM Certified Used Vehicles model. Chevrolet continues to position itself at the forefront of the industry by offering excellent certified used car services.<p><p>For your Chevrolet parts needs, visit <a href="http://www.partstrain.com/ShopByVehicle/CHEVROLET" target=new>http://www.partstrain.com/ShopByVehicle/CHEVROLET</a>.<p><p><p><p><p><table width=100% cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 border=0 bgcolor=#dddddd><p><tr><td><p><p><b>About The Author</b><br><p><p><p>Jenny McLane works as a Market Analyst for one of the country's leading auto parts distributors.
