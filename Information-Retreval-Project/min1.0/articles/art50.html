Ask yourself this first.<p><p>Why do we customize and add accessories to our Harley?<p><p>Well, for me it's simple!<p><p>We want to stand out above all else!  The last thing we want is to look like every Tom, Dick, and Harry out there on the road!<p><p>You may have different reasons.  You may want to add an Accessory to your bike because it fits with you and your taste.<p><p>There is an element of being practical as well.  If you install a nice chrome luggage rack on your back fender, or a detachable windshield, it not only looks good but it also serves a purpose.  How else would you carry your tent and keep bugs out of your teeth?<p><p>Not everyone has the same taste in customizing.  Thank God for that, or it sure would be boring taking a walk down on main street in Sturgis South Dakota during the 1st week of August.<p><p>Some people go overboard on customizing their bike.  Overboard for someone may be a masterpiece for someone else.  It all depends on who you are and what you're about.<p><p>How do you pick out a Harley Davidson Accessory or decide on customizing?<p><p>It's a hard question to answer.<p><p>I would suggest that you decide on what you want out of your bike.  Sit back and have a look at yourself.  What kind of biker are you anyway?<p><p>Are you a speed demon that likes to lay rubber on the road every now and then.  Do you get a kick out of doing a little showing off at bike rallies to friends and family?  Do you like to participate in show and shine contests?<p><p>If you are this person you may want to look at getting your engine rebuilt for increased horsepower.  You can't go wrong with a lot of Harley chrome either.  Just when you think you have had enough of chrome, you find some more in that catalog.<p><p>Don't worry, there is a chrome Harley Davidson motorcycle built to date.<p><p>Your style may be a little more subdued.  Your main motorcycling purpose in life may be ride the road and not waste time with anything else.  You would have to agree, most people still want to look good riding a Harley.<p><p>If you are this person you may only want one or two Accessories.  A nice luggage bag that slips over that backrest on your bike looks good when you are on a long trip and it serves a purpose.<p><p>Every Harley Davidson owner at some time or another has thought about adding an accessory to his or her motorcycle.  You rarely see a stock Harley Davidson!<p><p>Keep in mind the kind of person you are when making Harley Davidson Accessory choices.  A properly customized Harley is above all else, an extension of the owner who rides it.<p><p><p><p><p><table width=100% cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 border=0 bgcolor=#dddddd><p><tr><td><p><p><b>About The Author</b><br><p><p><p>Keith Nivon is an avid Harley Davidson Motorcycle Enthusiast!
