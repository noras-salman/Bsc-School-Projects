<b>Toyota Prius Making Waves for Hybrid Vehicles</b><br><p>&nbsp;by: <b>Jenny McLane</b><p><p><p><p>The concept vehicle a few years back is now making big news around the world. The Toyota Prius is currentle the cleanest family car on the planet today. Voted as the 2005 European Car of the Year, the Prius sets a new standard on hybrid cars.<p><p>The car was chosen as the winner from a list of seven finalists and beat the competition comprehensively. It gathered 406 points as compared to Citroën C4 (267), Ford Focus (228), and Vauxhall Astra (180). Other cars in the consideration were Renault Modus, Peugeot 407 and BMW 1-series.<p><p>Toyota Prius Hybrid featured prominently at this year's "Red Carpet Green Cars" event as twenty of Hollywood's A-listers are set to arrive at the Oscars in chauffeur-driven Toyota Prius hybrid vehicles instead of the customary gas-guzzling limos. Participants in the "drive" for global sustainability at the "Red Carpet -- Green Cars" event include veterans Susan Sarandon, Tim Robbins, and Robin Williams, as well as some new faces consisting of: Selma Hayek, Penelope Cruz, Layra Linney, and best actor nominee Leonardo DiCaprio among many others.<p><p>The latest Consumer Reports owner satisfaction survey reported the Toyota Prius won near-unanimous praise with 94 per cent of respondents saying that they would definitely get one again. The second-generation Toyota Prius becomes the first hybrid to top the list, sending the Lexus LS430 luxury sedan down to second place. The sporty Honda S2000 was in third place.<p><p>The owner satisfaction survey is part of the Consumer Reports annual survey, which asked its subscribers if they would buy the car or truck they own again, considering its price, performance, comfort, and reliability. This year CR received more than 250,000 responses to this question for 2002 to 2004 models, which were used to determine owner-satisfaction ratings and lists of Most and Least Satisfying vehicles.<p><p>Awareness of the benefits of hybrids has dramatically increased and fuel economy is the No. 1 purchase reason for the Prius, so it's safe to say that rising fuel prices are putting a spotlight on hybrid vehicles.<p><p>Toyota Prius’ use of technology is amazing. Turning a key in a traditional ignition does not do starting the Prius; instead it is initiated by pressing the round “Power” button on the dash. There is an interactive, touch sensitive, Multi-Information display screen mounted in the center console. The display has many modes and can show things like the energy flow between the power train components, fuel consumption, radio settings, climate control, or many of the Prius’ other functions.<p><p>Toyota Prius is certainly a hybrid car that is environment friendly. It carries an AT-PZEV rating, which makes the Prius one the cleanest production cars on the road today when it comes to emissions. It is 90% cleaner than that of the average car. Combined with the Prius’ excellent gas mileage, it is a great choice for the environment.<p><p>To share the spotlight with the Toyota Prius Hybrid car are the superbly engineered parts one can find at online stores like Partstrain.
