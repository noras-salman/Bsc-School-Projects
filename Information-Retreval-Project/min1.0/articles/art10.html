<b>How To Change a Tire Without Help</b><br><p>&nbsp;by: <b>Jakob Jelling</b><p><p><p><p>Learning how to change a tire can be one of the most useful things you could learn regarding your car. Having a flat tire in the middle of a route or on your way to an appointment can be a big problem if you do not know how to change it and have to wait for help, and therefore, it would be great if you can do it without having to wait for someone else.<p><p>In order to change a tire you should make sure you have parked your car at the side of the road and following all the safety rules that correspond to the case. You must apply the parking brake and place the shift in first gear. Then, you should look for the spare tire, the lug wrench and the jack. If you do not know where the spare tire is, you can look for it in the car owner's manual. <p><p>Once you have found all you need, you should start by taking off the hubcap of the tire you wish to remove. You should do this with the help of a screwdriver or the end of the lug wrench. Then you should loosen the lug nuts with only one turn, do not completely loosen them until you have lifted the car.<p><p>Next you should lift the car with the jack. If you do not know how to do this, you can find instructions in your car owner's manual on where to place the jack as well as the jack itself might bring some directions too. You should lift the car until the tire you wish to change is some inches away from the ground. Then finish removing the lug nuts and remove the tire.<p><p>Once you have removed the old tire, you should place the spare one in the correct place aligning the holes. Then, you should place the lug nuts and tighten them until they feel secure. Once you have done this, you must lower the car back to the ground and take the jack away from it. Then, you should have the flat tire repaired and change it back as soon as you can.<p><p><p><p><p><table width=100% cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 border=0 bgcolor=#dddddd><p><tr><td><p><p><b>About The Author</b><br><p><p><p>Jakob Jelling is the founder of <a href="http://www.autorized.com" target=new>http://www.autorized.com</a>.
