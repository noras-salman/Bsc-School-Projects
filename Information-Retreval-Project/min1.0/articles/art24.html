<b>Hydrogen Filling Station Approved for Mazda</b><br><p>&nbsp;by: <b>Jenny McLane</b><p><p><p><p>Mazda Motor Corporation has received authorization from the Japanese government to operate a hydrogen-gas filling station near its Hiroshima headquarters. The station stores and supplies fuel to Mazda vehicles powered by hydrogen rotary engines; the vehicles are currently under development. The station should be able to fill up to 10 vehicles a day. <p><p>The RX-8 Hydrogen Rotary vehicle, which runs on either hydrogen or gasoline will be marketed as a commercial model to public offices and enterprise users in Japan Mazda now continues its development of the world’s first dual-fuel rotary engine, the H2RE (Mazda RX-8 Hydrogen RE). The new facility will store and supply fuel for the hydrogen-rotary powered vehicles and Mazda looks likely to have street-legal versions in use within the next two years.<p><p>The novel concept appeared as part of the Mazda display at the International Detroit Motor Show in January, and builds on the colossal worldwide success of the Mazda RX-8 four-door coupe. The H2RE is powered by a modified version of Mazda's award-winning RENESIS rotary engine and features an electronically controlled hydrogen direct injection system on the rotor housing.<p><p>The hydrogen/rotary combination also offers superior environmental performance - zero CO2 emissions and near zero NOx emissions. The innovative engine can be built reliably at a relatively low cost because existing parts and production facilities are utilized. More importantly, the hydrogen/gasoline dual fuel system will enable the H2RE to travel beyond the range of the few hydrogen filling stations now available.<p><p>Mazda will continue to develop this technology for practical use and for  a hydrogen-fuelled society of the future. <p><p>For you Mazda vehicle's superb performance, search for your own Mazda Car Parts at <a href="http://www.partstrain.com/ShopByVehicle/MAZDA" target=new>http://www.partstrain.com/ShopByVehicle/MAZDA</a> order them, and have them delivered directly to you.
