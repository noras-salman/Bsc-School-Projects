Each is a statistically based risk for a specific population. The higher the risk associated with a person, the more he or she is likely to pay for coverage. We have elaborated on some of the risk factors below, but there are numerous others, including driver''s gender, miles driven per year, purpose for using the vehicle (commuting to work, using for work, leisure only), etc. \r<p><p>Factors you CANNOT easily change that affect your car insurance rates: \r<p><p>. Age \r<p><p>Statistically, drivers under the age of 25 are at greater risk of being in an accident than those over age 25. Drivers between the ages of 50 and 65 generally have the safest records. \r<p><p>. Gender \r<p><p>Women are statistically safer drivers. \r<p><p>. Marital Status \r<p><p>A married person will pay less than a single person with an identical driving record. Factors you CAN change that affect your car insurance rates \r<p><p>. Geography \r<p><p>Where you live makes a difference. Folks living in areas with little or no traffic are likely to spend less on insurance than those living in congested cities or suburbs because areas with a lot of traffic tend to see more accidents. Some neighborhoods also have a higher rate of vehicle thefts, which can result in a higher premium. \r<p><p>. Driving Violations \r<p><p>Having an accident or moving violations on your record (speeding tickets, DWI, reckless driving, etc.) put you at a higher risk for accidents and will likely mean a higher premium. Some insurance companies will penalize you for your record for as many as five years from when the incident occurred. However, keep in mind, as your record improves, your premium will get lower. \r<p><p>. Vehicle Type \r<p><p>El cheapo car will cost less to insure than that status symbol SUV sitting on 24" rims baby. \r<p><p>. Accident Claims \r<p><p>A driving record that is clean and free of accidents will hold fare better for you than lots of tickets and/or accidents. \r<p><p>. Credit Rating \r<p><p>Many insurance companies view having a poor, or even no credit history as suggestive of higher risk and thus, charge you a higher premium. \r<p><p>. Occupation \r<p><p>Insurers have statistically found a correlation between your occupation and risk. For instance, a newspaper delivery person is most likely a higher risk than the personal banker sitting at their desk all day. \r<p><p>Other factors that help determine premiums: \r<p><ul>\r<p>	<li>Driving distance to work \r<p>	<li>Miles driven each year \r<p>	<li>Years of driving experience \r<p>	<li>Business use of the vehicle \r<p>	<li>Whether or not you currently have auto insurance \r<p>	<li>Theft protection devices (often results in discounts) \r<p>	<li>Multiple cars and drivers (another opportunity for discounts) \r<p></ul>\r<p><p>What can I do right now to make sure I have the lowest premium? \r<p><p>Shop around and compare quotes from different insurers. They base their premiums on their claims experiences, which naturally differ. One company may see your area as a higher risk than others may. Another may charge more because of your occupation.

(2, 'Seven Steps to Filing Your Car Insurance Claim', '<b>Seven Steps to Filing Your Car Insurance Claim</b><br><p>&nbsp;by: <b>Jon Register</b><p><p>\r<p><p>Having even a teeny-tiny car accident can be one of life''s least enjoyable moments. However, accidents happen, and sooner or later, we all have the experience of meeting one of our fellow road travelers up close and personal. Using the following seven steps to filing your claim will help you get over this speed bump as smoothly as possible. \r<p><p>Step 1: Understand your policy \r<p><p>Before a loss, sit down and carefully read your insurance policy. Call your agent or company if you have any questions about what is or is not covered. \r<p><p>Step 2: Exchange information \r<p><p>If you are involved in an accident, get the other driver''s name, address, phone number, insurance carrier, and insurer''s phone number. Be prepared to give the same information about yourself to the other driver. You can find insurers'' telephone numbers on the proof-of-insurance cards that should be carried on your person when operating a motor vehicle. \r<p><p>Step 3: Identify witnesses \r<p><p>Ask witnesses to the accident for their names and phone numbers in case their account of the accident is needed. \r<p><p>Step 4: File an accident report \r<p><p>Contact local law enforcement officers to have an accident report prepared. If law enforcement is not reachable, accident reports and detailed instructions are available at all police departments, sheriff''s offices, your local Department of Motor Vehicles office, and on your local Department of Motor Vehicles'' web site. \r<p><p>Step 5: Notify your insurer \r<p><p>Contact your insurance company about the accident as soon as possible. An insurance adjuster will review the accident report to determine who caused the accident. If the accident was not your fault, you can have either your insurance company or the at-fault driver''s insurance company handle the repair or replacement of your vehicle. If you use the other driver''s company, you will not have a claim on your automobile policy and you will not have to pay a deductible. \r<p><p>Step 6: Do not release insurers too early \r<p><p>Do not relieve your insurance company of its responsibility until the damages are settled to your satisfaction. For example, have your insurance company handle the claim if the other party''s insurance company questions its policyholder''s negligence or offers an unacceptable settlement. \r<p><p>Step 7: Consider these settlement factors \r<p><ul>\r<p>	<p><li>Bodily injuries: You may be entitled to a monetary settlement for injuries caused by another at fault (liable) party. It can take several days for some injuries to become apparent. \r<p>	<p><li>Damages: The insurance company is responsible to pay for the reasonable cost of repairs to your vehicle. An insurance adjuster will assess the damage. Usually, insurance companies and auto body shops negotiate disagreements about what should be repaired. If you disagree with their conclusions, you have the right to obtain another appraisal at any auto body shop. \r<p>	<p><li>Appraisal clause: Most auto insurance policies include an appraisal clause, which can be used to help settle disputes about physical damage claims between you and your insurance company. (The appraisal clause does not apply for claims you file with the other party''s insurance company.) If you cannot reach an agreement with your company, you or your insurer can initiate the appraisal clause. Your appraiser and your insurer''s appraiser then select an independent umpire to try to resolve the dispute. Check your policy or ask your agent or insurance company for more information about the appraisal clause. \r<p></ul>\r<p><p>And that is it.

You should. The Highway Loss Data Institute analyzes the cost to insurance companies from theft, collision, and injury claims as they relate to cars. They look at the color of the cars, how many doors they have, and even break them down type. \r<p><p>The Highway Loss Data Institute is a nonprofit public service organization. It is closely associated with and funded through the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which is wholly supported by auto insurers.

Buy a Buick LeSabre and have relatively no chance of a theft loss. Compare that to the convertible Chevrolet Corvette that has over 5 times the average theft rate. You may have known that. However, did you know that the Toyota Celica has a 67% higher chance of theft than the Toyota Camry? \r<p><p>In addition, even though the 2002 Lexus IS 300 gets a "best pick" rating from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety for its performance on crash tests, previous years'' models of the same car are some of the most costly in terms of collision claims. "One of the factors that come into play there is the cost of repairing an expensive vehicle," says Russ Rader, with the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. \r<p><p>What about safety? You may be surprised at some of the results. For example, the Porsche 911 has a 67% less chance for injury claims than the norm. Go figure.

(4, 'Is Your Auto Insurance Company Rated?', '<b>Is Your Auto Insurance Company Rated?</b><br><p>&nbsp;by: <b>Jon Register</b><p><p>\r<p><p>Several national rating institutions rate insurance companies. Do coverages, rates, and service vary from company to company? Why can you pay less with one company than another can for the same coverages? Choosing the best insurance company for you is a crucial financial decision. Does your insurance company have the financial strength to safeguard you and your family? If the company cannot pay future claims or benefits, other issues become far less relevant. Financial strength ratings are an analysis of a wide variety of risks that could affect an insurance company''s long-term viability. Insurance companies have failed or ceased to operate due to inadequate financial strength, competitive forces, or changing dynamics in the marketplace. \r<p><p>Standard & Poor''s Ratings (<a href="http://www.standardandpoors.com" target=new>http://www.standardandpoors.com</a>) Financial strength ratings of insurance companies, plus detailed financial Insurer Profiles on nearly 4,000 companies. \r<p><p>Fitch Ratings (<a href="http://www.fitchratings.com" target=new>http://www.fitchratings.com</a>) Financial strength ratings of insurance companies. \r<p><p>Have you heard of the company where you are considering purchasing coverage? Do you have any experience with the company? \r<p><p>Ask your peers what experiences they have had. What is your sense of the reputation of the company? How quickly and easily are claims processed? Is there 24-hour claims service? Is the claims management in the house of the insurance company or have they outsourced? Auto insurance is meant to make you whole in the case of an accident with injury or property damage. It is to protect your assets and protect you from liability. You will want the peace of mind of a superior rated company when it comes time to manage and pay the claim. The financial health of a car insurance company is an often-overlooked area when shopping for the best auto insurance rate. It is human nature to make your comparison solely on the rates for the coverages. While this is certainly important, you should be aware of the company''s overall rating and level of satisfaction. Consulting insurance company ratings is crucial. Each company issues quarterly reports that are publicly accessible. You cannot always tell the future from the past. However, the past performance is a valuable insight into what expectation to have for your future coverage. One of the factors that are used in order to determine the companies'' ratings is how long they have been in business. If there is no history, you may be taking an unnecessary chance. Look for a company that has a history and make sure that history shows good performance. \r<p><p>What about the reputation of the insurance company? It is very simple to find this information. Just ask around. There are your peers, the BBB, and family. Many times these resources closest to you will be able to share experiences that are favorable or unfavorable regarding the company you are considering. In addition, each state has a Department of Insurance that keeps public information about companies. Use all the resources you can to determine which company is best for you. Once you have paid for the policy, you will then become keenly interested in customer service. Be aware of what the source of information is regarding the insurance company. Many companies put our information about themselves in the form of illustrations that are intended to make them look as good as possible. Of course, while these illustrations must be factual, you should be aware that you are not receiving objective information. \r<p><p>How can you quickly check the company rating?

If you own a lot of oil stock you may be happy, but  the rest of us can only grumble when we see prices jump higher at the pump.  The gas station is the easiest way to see how the rising cost of oil affects us, but there are many hidden costs, too.  \r<p><p>Much of the world’s oil now comes from the middle east.  We are able to see on a daily basis the price of being dependent on another part of the world for the energy we have come to rely upon.  The wars in that region may not be for oil specifically, but if there was no oil, there would be considerably less money to make war.  Most of the oil money goes to a few people who are in control.  The majority of the people in the oil rich countries remain poverty-stricken and greatly resent the way the cash flow does not improve their lives.\r<p><p>For every dollar we spend on gasoline or oil, a significant portion goes to companies paying taxes in foreign countries.  In much the same way that it hurts our country to lose jobs to foreign corporations, our economy suffers greatly when we buy foreign oil.\r<p><p>The U.S. population consumes an incredible amount of energy.  For most of us, mobility is necessary to live our daily lives.  We drive to work each day; chauffer our children from place to place, and rely heavily upon rental and company cars for business travel. In a more perfect world, mass transit or bicycles would be much better, but with frequently changing jobs, nomadic lifestyles and hectic schedules, these options are hardly practical.\r<p><p>Many people complain about the price of gas, the war and the terrorists who are funded by oil money.

(6, 'Formula One Cars - Unsurpassed Technology at Its Finest', '<b>Formula One Cars - Unsurpassed Technology at Its Finest</b><br><p>&nbsp;by: <b>Michael Walker</b><p><p>\r<p><p>Formula One Racing is, quite simply, the paramount of karting. It is the professional form of the sport in its entirety. Formula One is an international phenomenon, a media conglomerate that rakes in millions and millions of dollars a year from advertising, sponsorship, and broadcast revenues. Professional drivers with millionaire bank accounts race these majestic kart marvels that are unprecedented, flush with technological luxuries – everything from hard to produce lightweight frames that glide the machine to tires with unsurpassed grooving style that exemplify powerful movement on the circuit.\r<p><p>There is no sport that bests epitomizes the term “global sport” like Formula One racing. Many countries serve as active participants in shaping the professional karting scene – for example, Malaysia is a hot spot for racing (Fernando Alonso, a Spanish-born driver under Team Renault recently won a race there) and Italy plays a vital role in designing and manufacturing first class, top-of-the-line karts. Drivers and racing personalities hail from all parts of the word – you have the charismatic and popular Italian Renault boss Flavio Briatore, the handsome young 23 year old racing prodigy in Fernando Alonso who stars in a Renault Megane commercial with his pet pig, and one of the highest earning sports figures in world history in Michael Schumacher. Rivalries are common in Formula One – adding the edge of excitement with every zip of the curve and nitrous boost of the machine.\r<p><p>In order to better become acquainted with Formula One racing, we must understand its organization. Karting goes way beyond pitting 3 2-cycle engine machines against each other on an oval circuit. Formula One is divided into drivers & their respective teams. Under such trademark car companies like Renault, Ferrari, and Toyota – each driver has an assembling cast of staffers consisting of mechanics, engineers, and designers all working towards one goal: to make that speedster faster using all the resources at their disposal. Headed by team bosses that are adept at creating sponsorship opportunities and assembling the best cast for each team, Formula One employs the finest specialists in the business with backgrounds in computer and automobile – even specialists with aerospace experience! High end, (rare technology reserved for space projects) in some instances, create the fastest and most efficient car possible. According to FI rules, racing teams must design, construct, and built their own karts from scratch. The staff is the pride of each individual team – capable and able to win every 57 lap enduro race from Malaysia to Great Britain.\r<p><p>Formula One cars can be summed up in two words: technological marvels. These sleek, low riding gems ripping through laps at speeds topping 200 mph. consist of more than just a chassis, an engine, and four wheels. For starters, the engine is located behind the cockpit as opposed to standard automobiles. They consist of 10 cylinder engines that produce heat which propel the kart forward. Team engineers are always looking into ways to make their engines more powerful. Currently, 1000 bhp (a scale for horsepower) has not been topped – it is up to the teams to produce an engine which would fare well supporting speed as well as support the chassis. And as we know, there is a snug open cockpit for Jarno Trulli to maneuver his machine in.\r<p><p>Construction of Formula One race cars is unprecedented. The first rule of thumb in designing a bonafide piece of framework is to make it weigh as least as possible. Less kart weight correlates to faster speeds. For this reason, team brains use lightweight material that is hard to construct. The minimum weight of a kart must be 600 kg including the driver. This ensures a level playing field, although teams are allowed to keep their money making construction methods a secret from other teams. Team staff is very highly regarded in the Formula One business. Their technological and dynamical know-how of the machines they build is a valuable asset to any team. And like free agents, they are lured and signed by the likes of companies creating a recruiting war for their services. Of course, there are restrictions for creating karts. You cannot add nitro boosts to your machine or use technology that resembles life in the year 3000. Teams are always looking to bend the rules slightly and coming up ways to beat the competition legally.\r<p><p>Professional kart tires have to have optimum characteristics to ensure smooth driving. For one, tires have to have grooving technology built into them. For the novices, grooves are indented lines in tires that allow for it to slow down considerably on turns and to adapt to the track surface. No matter what the technology, kart tires are simply not adept at withstanding the rigors of asphalt, concrete, and dirt. For this reason, Formula One racers are allotted two pit stops during the course of a 57 lap race to change tires. If you’ve ever watched a Formula One race, team staffers with lightning quick hands have an extremely limited time for which to remove and replace tires in the pit stop – often times not exceeding over 7 seconds! Regulations are placed on tire grooves (a minimum of four) to allow for an even playing field for all racers. Remember enthusiasts, grooves serve more to slow down the kart than to speed it up. \r<p><p>Chassis construction with its illustrious carbon fiber material, tires with indented grooves, team specialists with a knack for speed, and engines which burn heat like calories is the epitome of a Formula One race car. All of these attributes contribute to the performance of the vehicle in racing lap after lap. As a result of all this technology, Formula One cars leave people breathless reaching consistent speeds of 200 mph. on the race track. More impressive is the time needed to go from 0 mph to 100 mph – 5 seconds! Formula One is only moving forward with the advent of new features - like improved horsepower engines, more lightweight materials, new ballasts to add weight to the car, and more. Behind that stylish, mind blowing chassis that pique our interest is that top-class technology that makes Formula One racing so great.\r<p><p><p><p><p><table width=100% cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 border=0 bgcolor=#dddddd><p><tr><td><p><p><b>About The Author</b><br><p>\r<p><p>Michael Walker is a freelance author providing information about a variety of go-kart topics including <a href="http://www.go-kart-kits.com" target=new>http://www.go-kart-kits.com</a>, <a href="http://www.go-kart-kits.com/go-karts-engines.html" target=new>http://www.go-kart-kits.com/go-karts-engines.html</a> and <a href="http://www.go-kart-kits.com/go-cart-parts.html" target=new>http://www.go-kart-kits.com/go-cart-parts.html</a>.

It uses Honda''s unibody large vehicle platform, shared with the Acura MDX and Honda Odyssey. It is powered by an all aluminum 255 hp 3.5 L V6 coupled to a 5-speed automatic transmission with all wheel drive capable of towing 5000 lbs. The Ridgeline will be the first pickup truck with a fully-independent suspension.\r<p><p>Some of the more innovative features of the Ridgeline are its tailgate, which can fold down or hinge to the side, and an 8.5 cubic foot “In-Bed Trunk" below the truck bed. The bed is integrated with the body, similar to the Chevrolet Avalanche. The Ridgeline comes with anti-lock brakes and side-curtain airbags as standard equipment. \r<p><p>The bed is 49.5” x 60” with the tailgate up. With the tailgate down, you get 49.5” x 79”. And remember, the tailgate also swings to the side so you can easily access the in-bed trunk. The tailgate is designed to support 300 lbs. While driving. The steel reinforced composite bed resists dents and corrosion. Another neat feature were ample tie downs in the beds and several cargo lights. \r<p><p>Standard towing features include prewiring 4 pin and 7 pin, along with a brake controller. Heavy duty radiator, power steering cooler, and transmission cooler keep things cool when the work begins. Huge 4 wheel disk brakes help stop quicker with the aid of the Electronic Brake Distribution (EBD). All the dealer has to do is install the hitch and harness. \r<p><p>The 8” ground clearance works well with the 4 wheel independent suspension. Yes, all 4 wheels. Unheard of in a truck, but this is a Honda. They wanted their truck to instill confidence in the corners and a stable, responsive feel while maintaining ride quality. The closed box frame and unit body construction means this truck is tough and ready to work.\r<p><p>Traction control is standard along with a locking rear differential for extremely low traction conditions. It can stay locked with a push of a button up to 18 mph. Along with traction control, you get stability control called Vehicle Stability Assist. This corrects your cornering problems before they even become a problem. \r<p><p>The tires come with tire pressure monitoring systems which will be standard in all vehicles very soon (government mandate). Air bags are all around in front, side, and side curtain. It will only deploy what is necessary depending on the type of accident. These safety features along with ABS braking make this one of the safest trucks on the road.\r<p><p>There are three trim levels starting with the RT, RTS and the luxury RTL. You can get heated leather seats and a moonroof. These amenities were only thought to be available in cars. This truck also has available navigation system, homelink, and a hidden in dash cd changer.\r<p><p>The 22 gallon tank is ample for the 16 MPG city and 21 MPG highway EPA mileage estimates. The six color combinations come with 3 interior choices. Options include a bed extender, tail light “garnish”, chrome bumper trim, 17” wheels, body side protectors, roof rack, fender flares, running boards and a towing package mentioned above. I’ve also seen hard tonneau cover-locking for the bed, and in-bed trunk dividers. There’s a larger brush guard for the front bumper available for you off roaders.\r<p><p>All in all, looks to be a pretty good and well thought out truck from Honda. Check out my pictures of the Honda Ridgeline at the car show on my website.\r<p><p><p><p><p><table width=100% cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 border=0 bgcolor=#dddddd><p><tr><td><p><p><b>About The Author</b><br><p>\r<p><p>Stuart Simpson\r<p><br><a href="http://www.hondalinks.com" target=new>http://www.hondalinks.com</a>\r<p>\r<p>\r<p>\r<p><p></td></tr><p></table>', 'articles/art9.html'),

Dealerships have moderate overhead that forces them to offer reduced trade-in values. In addition, they attempt to maintain a profit margin, as any business should. These expenses are passed on to buyers who take advantage of trading-in their current vehicle for the purchase of a new or pre-owned automobile. By attending to a few details, devoting time, and utilizing classifieds a consumer can achieve a quick sale and maintain monetary rewards for their efforts.\r<p><p>Attend to the Cars Exterior\r<p><p>Similar to selling a home, the cars exterior will provide a lasting first impression to prospective buyers. Wash the vehicle with a quality Car Wash. Ensure that brake dust is removed from the cars rims and wheel hubs. Remove built up road-dust from creases in the cars body. Pay extra attention to decorative moldings, door jams, and spaces between body parts. After washing the car, dry the vehicle with a shammy, to prevent dust from sticking to the clean surface.\r<p><p>Once the vehicle is dry and the surface is cool, wax the entire car with a quality carnauba wax. Read the instructions carefully before applying carnauba wax to the finish. Use a small hand applicator to wax creases and difficult to reach areas of the cars body. These areas are especially important to the external appearance of the vehicle.\r<p><p>Tend to rubber and plastic on the vehicles exterior. Apply high-gloss sun protectent to moldings and tires. Using an applicator, apply a generous amount of sun protectent product evenly. This should remove dulling that occurred from the sun or dust. Any product that is accidentally applied to the vehicles finish should wipe-off easily, as a result from the fresh wax that is protecting the finish.\r<p><p>Clean the Cars Interior\r<p><p>Use quality glass cleaner to remove built up residue from skin oils, cigarette smoke, and moisture that dried dust to the glass. Clean gauges and other glass-like surfaces that are in the vehicle. Use an interior cleaner to remove dust from the dashboard, instrument panel, door panels, and sun visors. Apply a high-gloss sun protectent to the plastic interior parts once they are cleaned.\r<p><p>Vacuum the cars upholstery and carpets. Using attachments for the vacuum, reach down between the seats and doors. Pay extra attention to the drivers-side of the vehicle near the pedals. Use a quality carpet cleaning product, as instructed, to remove stains in the carpet and upholstery.\r<p><p>Clean the Cars Engine Compartment and Attend to Minor Parts\r<p><p>There are a variety of products on the market that now make cleaning an engine simple. Many products may require the battery to be disconnected and water to rinse engine parts. Follow the instructions on the product of choice to achieve the best results. A clean engine is very important as consumers will want to see and inspect engine parts. When the motor is run, a clean engine will reveal any problems, if they exist. This is generally the consumer’s biggest concern.\r<p><p>Inspect all belts and hoses on the vehicle. If dry-rot appears, replace the hoses. If the belts are dry-rotted or cracked, replace them. Ensure that all fluid reservoirs all full to the proper level. This may include windshield wash, clutch fluid, transmission fluid, motor oil, and coolant.\r<p><p>Determine a Reasonable Marketing Price\r<p><p>Once the vehicle is clean and ready for consumer inspection, determine a fair value for the vehicle. This will require some research with similar models that are currently for sale. It may be in a seller’s best interest to review similar vehicles that are for sale. Compare the price and condition of the vehicles. Remember, marketing price is not necessarily the price a seller is willing to accept. Common negotiating principles are for seller’s to start high, and consumers to start low.\r<p><p>Review book values for the make and model of the vehicle. Kelly Blue book is a well known and used resource for establishing a fair value. Consider any modifications that have been made to the vehicle. Modifications may not be reflected within the Kelly Blue Book suggestion.\r<p><p>Gather Information and Place a Classified Ad\r<p><p>Route through receipts and gather maintenance records. Consumers will probably want to know what was done to the vehicle and how well it was maintained. By having these records ready before hand, it will reinsure trust that the vehicle was taken-care-of.\r<p><p>Be prepared to provide details regarding enhanced features or parts, provided by the manufacturer, for the model. A commonly overlooked feature is Low Jack car recovery devices. Custom wheels, stereo equipment, and engine type. Being able to provide these details will reinforce value to consumers who have viewed several similar vehicles.\r<p><p>Place an Ad for the vehicle. Avoid terms such as, “to many parts to list”. Instead, enter, “complete maintenance records available”. Describe the vehicle accurately. Many details can be found in the vehicles owner’s manual. Indicate the best time to contact the seller. A consumer, who continually calls without an answer, could give-up trying.

(9, 'Why Does a Car Engine Overheat?', '<b>Why Does a Car Engine Overheat?</b><br><p>&nbsp;by: <b>Jakob Jelling</b><p><p>\r<p><p>There are many different reasons that can cause an engine overheat, but they all have in common three aspects. The three aspects which all engine overheat factors have in common are that they cause that the heating system can not get rid of heat, they cause a loss of coolant or they directly cause too much heat in the engine.\r<p><p>One first problem which might be the cause of an engine overheat is a problem with the radiator cap and the pressure it holds. If the radiator cap does not hold pressure correctly then coolant could boil and therefore the engine would overheat. Another reason might be caused by thermostat failures; it is recommendable that you check it.\r<p><p>The car engine might also overheat due to coolant leaks such as those from the radiator, the hoses, the water pump, the freeze plugs or any others. Also, problems in the water pump could be the cause and therefore you should check it and replace it in case it is needed. \r<p><p>Some other reasons by which the car engine could overheat are problems in the exhaust system which you can discover by checking vacuum readings, pipes and converter. Besides, you should also make sure that the radiator hose has not collapsed and the ignition timing is working properly.\r<p><p>You should also check the electric cooling fan by making sure that the fan motor, the relay and temperature are correct or otherwise it could cause the engine to overheat. Besides this, you should also check the radiator in case there are any debris in it as well as you should check its hose in case it has collapsed. \r<p><p>It is also recommendable that you check the antifreeze concentration which should be 50/50 in order to be correct, otherwise it could cause the car engine to overheat. If you do not find why your engine does overheat, you should ask a mechanic or an expert for advice. You should not try to fix this if you do not have the proper tools and general car knowledge necessary for it.\r<p><p><p><p><p><table width=100% cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 border=0 bgcolor=#dddddd><p><tr><td><p><p><b>About The Author</b><br><p>\r<p><p>Jakob Jelling is the founder of <a href="http://www.autorized.com" target=new>http://www.autorized.com</a>.

Having a flat tire in the middle of a route or on your way to an appointment can be a big problem if you do not know how to change it and have to wait for help, and therefore, it would be great if you can do it without having to wait for someone else.\r<p><p>In order to change a tire you should make sure you have parked your car at the side of the road and following all the safety rules that correspond to the case. You must apply the parking brake and place the shift in first gear. Then, you should look for the spare tire, the lug wrench and the jack. If you do not know where the spare tire is, you can look for it in the car owner''s manual. \r<p><p>Once you have found all you need, you should start by taking off the hubcap of the tire you wish to remove. You should do this with the help of a screwdriver or the end of the lug wrench. Then you should loosen the lug nuts with only one turn, do not completely loosen them until you have lifted the car.\r<p><p>Next you should lift the car with the jack. If you do not know how to do this, you can find instructions in your car owner''s manual on where to place the jack as well as the jack itself might bring some directions too. You should lift the car until the tire you wish to change is some inches away from the ground. Then finish removing the lug nuts and remove the tire.\r<p><p>Once you have removed the old tire, you should place the spare one in the correct place aligning the holes. Then, you should place the lug nuts and tighten them until they feel secure. Once you have done this, you must lower the car back to the ground and take the jack away from it.

It has pioneered some of the revolutionary technologies such as the rotary engine. Now that environmental conservation has become a more important issue than ever before, Mazda faces up to the challenge by fully supporting the development of eco-friendly automobiles. Hydrogen-fuel is one of the cleanest and most environmentally friendly sources of energy. Mazda takes a big step forward in realizing a hydrogen-fueled society by launching the first hydrogen filling stations, located in Japan.\r<p><p>The new hydrogen filling station began operating last February 2005 and will store and supply fuel to the company''s ongoing hydrogen vehicle research and development. The hydrogen filling station is located near Mazda''s global headquarters in Hiroshima. This is the first filling station of its kind in the Chugoku region of western Japan. \r<p><p>High-pressure hydrogen gas is stored at about 2,900 psi in compressed hydrogen gas tanks. These are further pressurized to over 5,000 psi for delivery to the vehicles. The facility mainly supplies fuel to the company''s hydrogen testing facility. Hydrogen rotary-engined vehicles that are currently on the road for development and testing purposes are also served by the filling station. The stored hydrogen in the fueling station can currently fuel up to 10 vehicles per day.\r<p><p>Mazda is leading the pack in the development of hydrogen rotary engines. Last year, Japan''s Ministry of Land Infrastructure and Transport (MLIT) gave permission for the first public road tests of Mazda''s RX-8 Hydrogen Rotary (H2RE). This is a rotary-engined, dual-fuel vehicle that runs on either hydrogen or traditional gasoline. With this hydrogen fueling station, Mazda will continue to develop hydrogen rotary engines with the goal of introducing such vehicles into the market in two years time. \r<p><p>Mazda is at the forefront of automotive technology. It is fully dedicated to the design and development of automobiles that are a whole new level above the rest. Meanwhile, maintenance and repair is very important to keep a Mazda vehicle in top condition. Replacement parts are a great choice if a Mazda owner wants to keep his car in excellent form. Replacing worn out or damaged parts is a good way to maintain a vehicle. \r<p><p>Incidentally, purchasing replacement parts has never been easier. Anyone can now have access to the best Mazda parts even in the comfort of their own homes. A quick visit to any of the dozens of online auto parts stores is all you need.

Shanghai, one of the fastest growing financial centers in Asia has placed an order for 87 city buses from Volvo Buses. More than half of these will be the first midi-buses in China. \r<p><p>City bus operator ShenXin Bus of Shanghai, a joint venture company owned by ComfortDelgro Group of Singapore and Dazhong Group of China, ordered a 40 12-metre Volvo B7R Buses and 47 10.5-metre Volvo B6R Buses. All buses are air-conditioned. The midi-bus is very popular in China and is in fact a bestseller. A total volume of about 25,000 buses over 10m are sold every year. \r<p><p>The new buses will augment Dazhong group''s fleet of 5,200 buses, 290 of which are Volvos. Dazhong Group currently consists of five bus operators. On the other hand, ShenXin has 590 buses, including 69 Volvo B7Rs. Michael Liew; CEO of ShenXin said that most of the company''s 590 buses consist of some 20 different models of mainly Chinese brand. He further divulged that this fact presented a challenge when it comes to maintenance and repair. They decided to purchase more buses from Volvo, owing to the positive experience they gained from the first Volvo buses they bought. This is part of a long term partnership between ComfortDelgro, ShenXin and Volvo.\r<p><p>Liew added that one of the reasons why they chose Volvo is that the aftersales support is excellent. Thus, they are also planning a five-year service contract for the new buses. Sunwin Bus of China, a joint venture between Volvo Buses and SAIC of Shanghai, will manufacture the buses and will be ready for delivery by summer. \r<p><p>With this new deal, Jan Vandooren, Marketing and Sales Manager of Sunwin Bus says that purchasing new city buses in China is considered more and more as an investment rather than an initial cost. He concludes that, "Uptime, life time cost and passenger comfort are already becoming the decisive factors in the purchase procedure of the Shanghainese operators.\r<p><p>This new purchase agreement between Volvo and Shanghai, underscores the excellent quality and reputation of Volvo Motors and its subsidiaries. Volvo''s products, including these Buses, are manufactured using the best and latest technologies. Volvo Cars, long considered as a luxurious and excellent quality brand, continues to enjoy a growing global market share. \r<p><p>Superior aftersales support was one of the reasons cited by Shanghai Bus operators why they chose Volvo. Maintenance and repair is considerably less of a hassle with Volvo. This can also be attributed to the abundance of top-quality parts in the market today. Any Volvo car owner can have easy access to the best Volvo Parts for maintenance and repair. One of the easiest and fastest ways to purchase Volvo Auto Parts is through online auto parts stores.

As these price increases become more accepted by consumers, so too are the longer terms that are necessary to fit them into cost of living budgets. At one point, the magic payment amount for the retail automobile market was $200 per month. But that payment would only satisfy a loan of approximately $8000- 10000 depending on interest rates. \r<p><p>The average car payment today is closer to $400 per month and that''s with financial institutions stretching the terms to 72-84 and 120 months. Something has gone terribly wrong in the psyche of consumers to even imagine that an automobile will not become obsolete before it is all paid up, 6, 7 or 10 years down the road. \r<p><p>All they really need to do is take a look at a vehicle sold in 1995, 1997 or 1999, to get a live preview of what their new car will look like and potentially what it will be worth. Interestingly, research indicates that most Americans get bored with a car after driving it for 24-36 months. Why then would the typical financing term be 72-120 months? \r<p><p>At the point of purchase, most consumers tend to forget that car payments never include the cost of insurance, required maintenance and gas. When these items are added to a car payment, it can easily exceed what some people are paying in mortgages. \r<p><p>It''s analogous to the Middle Eastern people like Iranians whose culture practices beating themselves on the back with chains and whips. Every month, millions of Americans face the self-inflicted pain of making another car payment. Like the Iranians, they believe that if they can do it, it must be good and it will somehow make them better people in the hereafter. \r<p><p>A self-made millionaire, Dr. Cooper, an advocate for reversing unnecessary consumer debt has come up with a simple plan to change how we think of automobile ownership. His plan uses the same philosophy that our grand fathers grew up with, i.e. never buy anything that you cannot afford to pay for out of your own pocket. \r<p><p>Unfortunately, if we lived by those rules we would need traffic lights and zebra crossings on our major highways because they would be packed with pedestrians. \r<p><p>Well let''s share Dr. Cooper''s plan. He calls it the "Vehicle Saving Fund". This is a basic commercial bank savings account that can be started at any local bank. To make it more meaningful to you, lets call it the "Freedom From Car Payment Fund." Anyone can start such a fund; it does not matter if they are currently financing a vehicle. \r<p><p>The idea is that if you intend to be a productive member of society and enjoy the benefits of your labor you will need to have personal transportation. This is not optional for most people who do not live in a big city where public transportation is available. The fund should be considered absolutely necessary, much like the rent or mortgage, it''s a living expense. \r<p><p>Here is how it works; if you are currently driving a financed vehicle, resolve to pay it off in its normal term. It''s hard to keep making payment on a vehicle you do not like but that''s where the discipline becomes important. Also, resolve to put aside a small amount every month to your "Freedom From Car Payment" account. Initially, it is totally understandable that it may be a little difficult but the amount is not important, it''s the habit and the psychology of doing it that makes all the difference. You can start with as little as $5-$10-$25 just be committed to doing it every month until it becomes a habit. \r<p><p>You will also have to make a decision to continue driving the vehicle you are currently paying, this plan does not work if you decide that you need a new vehicle before paying off the one you are driving. The closer you are to your end of term, the better position you will be in to get what you want. But there is no rush, when you pay it off you should then begin to put the amount of your previous payment into your vehicle fund. Now with the equity in your current vehicle and your savings you can begin shopping. \r<p><p>Considering the prices of automobiles today, there is a high probability that because of your vehicle depreciation and the small savings, you might not have enough money to buy a new vehicle. If you do not have enough to purchase what you want, there are always other options; the first is to buy what you can afford. The alternative (worst-case scenario) is facing the dealer with no savings and having negative equity in the vehicle you are currently driving. \r<p><p>Strange concept, I know, but when its all said and done, transportation is transportation, it gets you from point A to point B. The only difference is what you are willing to pay to get there. For many, because of the values they hold "whatever it takes" is an appropriate answer but the mind set has to now change to discipline and the desire to stop making lifetime payments. \r<p><p>If you don''t have a car right now and are enjoying the bliss of not having a financial obligation to an automobile, you can begin your savings immediately so that when the time comes you will have a sizable chunk to begin your search for your new car. You are in a very good position if you are not in the market presently looking for a vehicle. \r<p><p>You have the time to save and plan for your next automobile. Begin the "Freedom From Car Payments Fund" today and in a couple of years you will really be much better off. Contrary to what dealers try to make you believe, car ownership does require long term planning in order to break the cycle of swapping payments every 3-4 years. It is a long term serious investment. \r<p><p>It''s that simple. Easy, no but simple, and it can be done. It requires discipline and patience two characteristics that are not easily harnessed in by the now generation. The obvious benefit is no car payment but you will also save on insurance and have much more disposable income for other necessities. With determination, a little vision and planning anyone can drive exactly what they want; without the burden of a monthly payment. Could that be you?\r<p><p><p><p><p><table width=100% cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 border=0 bgcolor=#dddddd><p><tr><td><p><p><b>About The Author</b><br><p>\r<p><p>Tony Puckerin is an Automobile Broker in Southern Florida who represents clients at local automobile dealerships.

Ideally, you should check them once a month as well as any other time when they might look low. Also, if you are planning a long trip with your car, tire pressure is one of the main things you should check, along with a general checking.\r<p><p>The first thing you need in order to be able to check your car''s tire pressure is a tire pressure gauge. You can acquire one at any car parts store or just use one in a gas station. All gas stations have one, but you should ask if it is functioning well before using it. Some of the gauges you might find in gas stations are old or damaged and therefore the information they would give you would be incorrect, which could even lead you to add more air to the tire than it should have. This way, it is important that you make sure the gauge you will use functions properly. \r<p><p>In order to be able to evaluate the pressure your tires have, you should learn how much pressure they should ideally have. You might easily learn this since your car''s driver side doorjamb will probably have a sticker giving you some guidance related to the tires and their pressure.\r<p><p>Once you know which the proper pressure for your tires is, you are ready to check them. In order to do this, you must unscrew the caps on the tire air valve and press the tire pressure gauge against it. You should make sure you keep the tire pressure gauge as firmly against the tire valve as not to let air come out from it. \r<p><p>Once you have the tire pressure gauge connected with the tire valve, the gauge will immediately tell you what the tire pressure is. This will allow you to learn weather the tire needs more air or its air pressure is correct. If it needs more air, you should do it carefully in order not to pass its air limit. And, in case its air pressure is correct, you simply need to disconnect the air pressure gauge from it and screw the valve cap back in its place.\r<p><p><p><p><p><table width=100% cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 border=0 bgcolor=#dddddd><p><tr><td><p><p><b>About The Author</b><br><p>\r<p><p>Jakob Jelling is the founder of <a href="http://www.autorized.com" target=new>http://www.autorized.com</a>.

Due to all these reasons, it is very important that you buy the right fuel treatments for your car instead of choosing them randomly.\r<p><p>If you wish to learn which the right fuel treatments for your car are, you should start by consulting your car owner''s manual. Most car owner''s manuals come with indications regarding the use of fuel treatments and some of them would let you know which ones you should buy and which ones you should avoid since some of them could be very prejudicial.\r<p><p>Fuel treatments are applied in order to improve specific car functioning areas and therefore you should have a clear idea on what you need to correct before buying the treatment fuel for it. This way, one of the best ways to make sure you will buy the right fuel treatment for your car is by choosing it according the specific problem it is going through.\r<p><p>Although there are some low cost treatments which are not bad, you should always try to make sure you buy a well known one or one which has been recommended to you by your mechanic or someone who knows what he is talking about. Another great way to buy your treatments is when they are on sale which happens very often in many stores.\r<p><p>After you have bought the right treatment, you should wait to add it until the next time you will add gas to the tank. This way, you should add the treatment, with a maximum of one bottle, and then add the gas you wish. If you have any doubts regarding fuel treatments you should ask your mechanic, or, in case you have doubts on how to use it you should ask the treatment manufacturer for further advice. You shouldn’t add any treatment to your car if you are not sure about it and what it could do to the car.\r<p><p><p><p><p><table width=100% cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 border=0 bgcolor=#dddddd><p><tr><td><p><p><b>About The Author</b><br><p>\r<p><p>Jakob Jelling is the founder of <a href="http://www.autorized.com" target=new>http://www.autorized.com</a>.

If your air filter doesn''t work properly and dirt enters your car this might make it go through different problems, and therefore it is important that you check the filter and change it when necessary. Your mechanic can do it for you although it is very easy and you could do it yourself as well.\r<p><p>It is recommended that you change your car''s air filter once a year or every 15.000 miles if you live in an averagely dusty area. But, if you can check it once in a while and replace it as soon as it needs it this would be much better. Checking it is a very easy thing to do and replace it is not complicated once you learn how to do it.\r<p><p>If you wish to check your car''s air filter yourself and in an easy way, you can do so by using a light from inside pointing outside and check how bright it looks through it. If you see the light clearly, then your air filter is still good, but if you can''t see much of the light then it indicates the filter needs to be changed. \r<p><p>Newer cars have different air filters than older ones. If your car is rather new, its air filter is probably rectangular and you might find it located under the hood, near the radiator area or the fender wells. In order to change it, you must open it and take the actual air filter from it, replacing it by the new and then closing it again.\r<p><p>If your car is older, then the air filter will probably be of a big round shape and located near the engine area. It might probably be screwed, and all you might need to do is to unscrew the cover, let the air filter come out, and place the new one instead of it. You must pay attention in case it has any other attachment mechanisms such as clips which you would need to take off as well.\r<p><p><p><p><p><table width=100% cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 border=0 bgcolor=#dddddd><p><tr><td><p><p><b>About The Author</b><br><p>\r<p><p>Jakob Jelling is the founder of <a href="http://www.autorized.com" target=new>http://www.autorized.com</a>.

The first is a body kit.  Next, most people want to add personalization to the interior.  Last, we want to talk about engine modifications.  These upgrades you may want to do in any particular order, depending on your personality.  I started with my engine.  I want my car to be a “sleeper”.  When I add a body kit, then I’ll have the muscle to back it up.  But it all depends on you.  Let’s start with the body kit for your Honda Civic.\r<p><p>If you have a pre-1988 Honda Civic, body kits were made, but they are hard to find.  There really wasn’t much of an internet, so the market was limited to larger cities or Japan.  Today, you could search for a used Mugen kit and probably find one on the internet.  For later Civics, there are a couple of good choices.  Stillen and Greddy offer quality components.  When purchasing bargain components, remember you may have to modify the kit for proper alignment.  For example, the exhaust may not be exactly in the right spot.  Rework time to your Civic may end up costing you as much as a higher quality kit.  I’ve looked at the kits you can buy a piece at a time due to my budget.  Adding the front air dam to keep the car on the ground, side skirts and a rear valance all at once can be a little imposing on the pocketbook.  \r<p><p>Interior modifications may not impress anyone as you drive down the street, but if the car looks good on the outside, you’ll want that Civic sharp on the inside.  A torn seat or other imperfections are a good place to start.  Most people start with the radio.  But if you have a newer Civic or Accord and the radio is already pretty good, what can you do to add your own style?  Add some gauges.  You can add a pillar mount gauges the A-frame that supports the roof.  A company called Lotek makes nice gauge pods.  \r<p><p>When you add the gauges, now you have interior style and you can keep better check on your motor instead of relying on a red warning light.  The first thing to do is get a free flowing intake.  Not only do these look good in the engine compartment, but also they help the car breath better.  There are several to choose from, but I’m biased towards K & N Products.  They fit perfectly and are completely washable.  Be warned, you can here the engine breathing when you hit the gas!  It’s so cool!\r<p><p>I hope these gave you a good starting point on what you can do with your Honda Civic, Accord, or Prelude.

Satellite radio is a new service being offered by two companies, XM Satellite Radio and Sirius Satellite Radio. Both companies are offering over 100 channels of streaming music and entertainment. High quality sound is achieved through the use of satellites orbiting high above. Satellite radio is commercial free and free from regulations by federal committees. The impossible, is now possible, hearing the same radio station across North America and from coast to coast. All made possible by XM satellite radio and Sirius satellite radio.\r<p><p>Normal radio has been around for decades and is part of many people’s lifestyle.  This is changing.  Regular radio is monitored and regulated by the Federal Communications Commission, whom has fined several radio stations and media companies within the last 3-4 years.  The FCC has only fined radio stations a maximum of $27,500 per show no matter how man profanities were aired.  Recently the FCC has been upping the ante and in conjunction with Congress has decided to raise the fine up to $500,000 per incident per station (Potter).  A slap on the wrist has turned into a business-changing event.  “Sexually explicit comments by Bubba the Love Sponge and Howard Stern could get a station in trouble — no doubt about it. Clear Channel Radio dropped both shock jocks this year after being hit with record fines.”(Potter)  Recently Howard Stern has made a move to Sirius Satellite Radio in an effort to preserve his career and free speech.  Consumers are reaching towards satellite radio as a way to hear unregulated news and content.  Recently XM Satellite Radio has claimed to have over 3 million subscribers paying $9.99 per month and Sirius claims to have over 1.3 million customers paying $12.95 per month.  Many of those customers pay an additional $2.99 per month for premium content such as the upcoming Howard Stern Show.  \r<p><p>Several normal radio stations and media outlets are realizing the potential to get their message across in a broad fashion.  XM has launched a morning show, which is hosted by Bob Edwards, whom was fired earlier this year by National Public Radio.   "The Bob Edwards Show" will air on a public satellite radio channel that also features news and programs from Public Radio International, among others. Sirius has its own public radio channel carrying NPR programs.   Consumers and companies are demanding free speech and it seems that satellite radio is the vehicle.  \r<p><p>XM Satellite Radio and Sirius Satellite Radio have designed satellite broadcast systems that differ but they achieve the same high quality of satellite radio. A milestone of this success is the fact that satellite radio signals that are available across the United States and into Mexico and Canada. Rock and Roll – No it’s not a genre any more! XM Satellite Radio has two satellites named Rock and Roll, which remain in parallel geostationary orbit to provide radio coverage throughout the United States. Sirius Satellite Radio has chose to use three satellites in an inclined elliptical orbit. This configuration provides 16 hours per satellite of signal, which gives a great redundancy if any satellite were to fail. Playing it smart, Sirius and XM both have spare satellites, which can be called on in a moments notice if needed.\r<p><p>XM satellite radio and Sirius satellite radio have Earth based broadcast stations that are used to send up information to the satellites, which is then dispersed through out the globe. Sirius and XM both have disk jockeys that manage, create and program music which is then sent up to the satellites. The information is then taken in by the satellites and sent through a rebroadcast of the streams to earth. The Major advantage of this is that, unlike earth-based radio stations whose signals reach listeners 150 miles away, satellite radio signals have a huge reach, and are receivable anywhere within the continental United States and hundreds of miles in each direction of the borders. Satellite Radio is growing to become a worldwide network and offerings are growing throughout the world. XM satellite radio and Sirius satellite radio are making it happen.   \r<p><p>Unregulated Satellite Radio is the answer for free speech in a government regulated airwaves arena.  Not only can listeners hear unbiased information but also they can listen to it anywhere in the United States.

Customer service, reliability, and trustworthiness are all important factors in choosing a transport company. An unscrupulous trucker can cost you money, damage your property, and cause you a hard time.\r<p><p>Recommended Steps to take before hiring a transport company:\r<p><ul>\r<p>	<p><li>Ask Questions - When you first contact a hauler, you should ask as many relevant questions as you can regarding the care they will take with your property, scheduling, contract issues, what type of equipment they have, licensing, insurance, and take some time to get a feel for the type of people you are dealing with. The vast majority of truckers / haulers are reputable business people that simply want to help you, the best way to weed out the few that aren''t is in this first stage.\r<p>	<p><li>Get References - Most haulers should be prepared to provide you with several references in regards to RECENT jobs they have done. If time allows try to contact every reference and ask questions regarding the type of service they received from their hauler. Remember, that no one is perfect all of the time, so if there are any less than perfect reviews, follow up with a question to see how the hauler resolved the issue. \r<p></ul>\r<p><p>Sample questions to ask provided references:\r<p><ul>\r<p>	<li>What did you have __(company name)___ haul?\r<p>	<li>When did they haul it?\r<p>	<li>Did they keep you well informed of their pickup / delivery schedule?\r<p>	<li>How well did they keep their original promised schedule?\r<p>	<li>Did they take good care of your (car, boat, horse, furniture, etc..)?\r<p>	<li>If any problems occurred, how did the hauler resolve them?\r<p>	<li>How would you rate your overall experience with this hauler?\r<p>	<li>Would your recommend this hauler to others?\r<p></ul>\r<p><p>Use the above questions in an e-mail or as a template for a phone conversation with the provided references, and you will have a very good idea of what to expect when you use the hauler yourself.\r<p><ul>\r<p>	<p><li>Check Licensing - Your hauler should be able to provide you with his DOT number, and MC, Number. You can check the validity of their DOT number at the FMCA website: <a href="http://li-public.fmcsa.dot.gov/LIVIEW/pkg_carrquery.prc_carrlist" target=new>http://li-public.fmcsa.dot.gov/LIVIEW/pkg_carrquery.prc_carrlist</a> - A DOT license lets you know that the hauler has filed the proper paperwork and pays the proper taxes and fees when hauling your items. \r<p>	<p><li>Check Insurance - It''s important for you to know that your carrier has adequate insurance to cover potential damage to your property. If you choose an uninsured or underinsured transport company you risk not being compensated for loss or damage of your (car, boat, horse, furniture, etc..).\r<p>	<p><li>Check FindAHauler Profile - If your hauler has a profile in the <a href="http://FindAHauler.com" target=new>FindAHauler.com</a> Directory: <a href="http://FindAHauler.com/directory/" target=new>http://FindAHauler.com/directory/</a> you can view any feedback left regarding the hauler by other visitors to the site.\r<p>	<p><li>Read contracts carefully - Many haulers will have you execute a transport contract prior to hauling your (car, boat, horse, furniture, etc..). Make sure that you read the contract and understand the provisions of the contract. If there is a down payment required, make sure you know the conditions under which it will or won''t be refunded. Is the down payment due prior to the pickup of your property, when is the full payment due?. It is generally not advisable to pay a down payment prior to pickup of your property. If it is practical, you may want to negotiate the full payment upon delivery of your property. \r<p></ul>\r<p><p>If you follow the above advice, you should have an easy and stress free experience having your car, boat, horse, furniture, etc... transported.

The success of this project is important in making the fuel cell vehicle competitive with gasoline-powered automobiles when it comes to driving range. In a press release last January, DOE elucidated that metal hydrides, formed when metal alloys are combined with hydrogen, can absorb and store hydrogen in their structures. When subjected to heat, the hydrides release the hydrogen. This hydrogen can then be combined with oxygen to produce electricity. This is how a fuel-cell system works.\r<p><p>GM and Sandia have commenced a four-year, $10 million program to develop and test tanks that store hydrogen in a complex hydride called sodium aluminum hydride, also known as sodium alanate. The mission is to develop a solid-state hydrogen storage tank with more capacity for hydrogen on a fuel-cell vehicle than current conventional storage methods can. They also hope to create a new tank design that is suitable to any type of solid state hydrogen storage.\r<p><p>"We are designing a hydrogen storage system with challenging thermal management requirements and limits on volume and weight," says Chris Moen, manager of science and engineering technologies at Sandia. "Our staff researchers are excited to apply their unique, science-based design and analysis capabilities to engineer a viable solution."\r<p><p>This program is part of a determined effort to improve the hydrogen storage capabilities aboard a fuel-cell vehicle to equal the driving range of a tank of gas. This will make fuel-cell systems more acceptable to consumers. Currently, the most common methods of storage are liquid and compressed gas, but neither of the two has been able to provide the needed range and running time for fuel cell vehicles.\r<p><p>GM is the world''s largest vehicle manufacturer selling nearly 8.6 million units in 2003, or about 15 percent of the global market. \r<p><p>Meanwhile, another lucrative segment of the automotive market is auto parts.

The station stores and supplies fuel to Mazda vehicles powered by hydrogen rotary engines; the vehicles are currently under development. The station should be able to fill up to 10 vehicles a day. \r<p><p>The RX-8 Hydrogen Rotary vehicle, which runs on either hydrogen or gasoline will be marketed as a commercial model to public offices and enterprise users in Japan Mazda now continues its development of the world’s first dual-fuel rotary engine, the H2RE (Mazda RX-8 Hydrogen RE). The new facility will store and supply fuel for the hydrogen-rotary powered vehicles and Mazda looks likely to have street-legal versions in use within the next two years.\r<p><p>The novel concept appeared as part of the Mazda display at the International Detroit Motor Show in January, and builds on the colossal worldwide success of the Mazda RX-8 four-door coupe. The H2RE is powered by a modified version of Mazda''s award-winning RENESIS rotary engine and features an electronically controlled hydrogen direct injection system on the rotor housing.\r<p><p>The hydrogen/rotary combination also offers superior environmental performance - zero CO2 emissions and near zero NOx emissions. The innovative engine can be built reliably at a relatively low cost because existing parts and production facilities are utilized. More importantly, the hydrogen/gasoline dual fuel system will enable the H2RE to travel beyond the range of the few hydrogen filling stations now available.\r<p><p>Mazda will continue to develop this technology for practical use and for  a hydrogen-fuelled society of the future. \r<p><p>For you Mazda vehicle''s superb performance, search for your own Mazda Car Parts at <a href="http://www.partstrain.com/ShopByVehicle/MAZDA" target=new>http://www.partstrain.com/ShopByVehicle/MAZDA</a> order them, and have them delivered directly to you.

Mercedes-Benz is set to become the first car manufacturer to integrate the Apple iPod. The user-friendly system, developed by Mercedes-Benz Accessories GmbH, will be introduced in the European market initially for the new B-Class. By July, it will be available for the A-Class, C-Class, E-Class, M-Class, CLK-Class, CLS-Class and SLK-Class model series, and will be available later in the year for the new R Class. \r<p><p>Operating the intelligent iPod Interface Kit is just as easy as navigating through the iPod''s menus and selects items such as "Playlist", "Artist", or "Album" using the buttons on the multifunction steering wheel. The volume is controlled in the same way while the central display on the dashboard indicates the song title or whichever menu item has been selected and provides details about the files saved on the MP3 player. The driver keeps his or her hands on the steering wheel and does not need to look away from the traffic situation ahead. It helps ensure that the driver''s attention is not diverted from the road.\r<p><p>Another advantage of the iPod Interface Kit is that the vehicle and the MP3 player are linked up "plug and play"-style. The user has only to is connect the iPod to the specially provided interface in the glove compartment. Configuration is automatic. \r<p><p>The Mercedes-Benz system is compatible with the iPod from Generation 3, the iPod mini, the iPod photo and the iPod U2.

One major feature of the B-Class is the sandwich concept developed by Mercedes-Benz.

Intensity of spirit possessed by very few sports cars – this was what Program Manager Takao Kijima has in mind when creating the all-new Mazda MX-5.\r<p><p>The all-new Mazda MX5 epitomizes the Japanese word Jinba Ittai (rider and horse as one).Jinba Ittai is akin to the bond between a single-seat formula-car pilot and his racer which is the essence of Zoom-Zoom. The rider-and-horse idiom and the effort to create a car universally seen as "lots of fun" served as the focal point around the new Mazda MX5.\r<p><p>Mazda engineers to realise the Jinba Ittai concept defined the five basic requirements: the car would be as compact and as light as possible while meeting global safety requirements; the cockpit would comfortably accommodate two full-stature occupants with no wasted space; the basic layout would continue with the original’s front-midship rear-drive configuration with the engine positioned ahead of the driver but behind the front axle for 50:50 weight distribution; all four wheels would be attached by wishbone or multi-link suspension systems to maximize tire performance, road grip and dynamic stability and that a power-plant frame would again provide a solid connection between the engine and rear-mounted differential to sharpen throttle response.\r<p><p>Mazda engineers made every gram count when they very well knew that extra weight would have a dramatically negative influence on driving, cornering, and braking performance. Their "gram strategy" assessed weight in the smallest possible increments and carefully scrutinized weight-trimming opportunities. Other weight-saving tactics were employed as well. Advanced technology was applied where practical to achieve a light and rigid unibody design using materials that offered higher strength and lighter weight.\r<p><p>The MX5 iconic roadster has indeed evolved as evident on its bold new look. The classic "Coke bottle" shape of the contours was removed. The nose and tail are smoothly tapered but now the surfaces wrap smoothly between the wheels without narrowing. The fender arches of the new Mazda MX-5 are notably more pronounced for a substantially wider wheel track dimensions and a more athletic stance. Seventeen-inch wheels help define the corners of the car while there are modest increases in wheelbase (+65 mm), length (+20 mm), width (+40 mm), and height (+20 mm),\r<p><p>With Mazda’s new generation sport car architecture the car boasts 22 per cent more flexural stiffness and a 47 per cent increase in torsion rigidity compared with the former Mazda MX-5''s. \r<p><p>Moving the engine rearward by 135 mm was a major step towards balancing front-to-rear weight distribution and reducing the yaw moment of inertia. The new car also benefits from ideal 50:50 weight distribution.\r<p><p>What makes this Mazda so special in the eyes and hands of car enthusiasts the world over? The parts that make up every inch of the Mazda MX5 as the iconic roadster are one of the reasons. You can come across super durable replacement parts on websites like <a href="http://www.partstrain.com/ShopByVehicle/Mazda" target=new>http://www.partstrain.com/ShopByVehicle/Mazda</a>.

A four-door sedan with all the power, handling and functionality required to effectively patrol streets, the 2006 Dodge Charger is perfect for the job. "With rear-wheel drive and available HEMI? power at the pavement, the Dodge Charger provides optimum police car pursuit performance," said Darryl Jackson, Vice President - Dodge Marketing, Chrysler Group. "Dodge has a strong police heritage and is proud to offer vehicles armed with modern muscle and cutting-edge technology". The Dodge Charger police vehicle will join the Dodge Magnum, another Dodge model previously announced to charge into the market. The two models will round out Dodge''s growing fleet of bold, powerful and capable vehicles designed for law enforcement agencies.\r<p><p>"We listened to what law enforcement officers asked for and paid attention to the details that are important to them," said Ray Fisher, Vice President - Sales, Service and Parts Operations, Chrysler Group. "By integrating features and functionality into the original design of the Dodge Charger, we can give our police customers an affordable, capable vehicle with industry-leading innovations."\r<p><p>The Dodge Charger police vehicle will be available with a 5.7-liter HEMI V-8 engine that produces 340 Horsepower at 5000 rpm and 390 lbs.-ft. of torque at 4000 rpm. The V-8 HEMI engine also features Chrysler Group''s Multi-Displacement System (MDS). This system effortlessly alternates between smooth, high economy four-cylinder mode when less power is needed and V-8 mode when more power is required. With the MDS in place fuel efficiency is also improved by up to 20 percent without compromising performance. The HEMI engines will also allow the Dodge Charger police vehicle to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in just 6.0 seconds. \r<p><p>Meanwhile, the Dodge Charger is also available with a powerful 3.5 liter High Output V-6 engine hat provides 250 horsepower at 6400 rpm and 250 lbs.-ft. of torque at 3800 rpm. Other excellent features include a fully electronic five-speed automatic transmission with an Electronically Modulated Converter Clutch offering improved shift feel to match a variety of driving styles, situations and road conditions. This will prove to be very useful in police operations throughout the country. This transmission is standard in all Dodge Charger police cars. Meanwhile, tough brakes and linings will provide a secure and stable deceleration and braking capability.\r<p><p>With these two models, Dodge will once again dominate the police car market which it lorded over in the 1960s, 70s and 80s. During that period, the former Chrysler Corporation had a market share of 45-60 percent in the US. Some of the police vehicles manufactured by the former Chrysler Corporation include Dodge Monaco, Dodge Royal Monaco, Dodge Coronet, Dodge Diplomat, Dodge Dart, Dodge St. Regis, Plymouth Fury, Plymouth Gran Fury, Plymouth Volare and Chrysler Newport. \r<p><p>Dodge, Chrysler''s best selling brand, currently enjoys a US market share of seven percent, making it the fifth largest nameplate in the US automotive market. Dodge also continues to lead the minivan market with a 20 percent share of the market. Meanwhile, when it comes to Dodge auto parts, one of the leading online suppliers is Auto Parts Train.

(29, 'Interference Engines and Timing Belts', '<b>Interference Engines and Timing Belts</b><br><p>&nbsp;by: <b>Ralph Hoffmann</b><p><p>\r<p><p>Interference Engines: ........ Useful information by <a href="http://AutoTruckData.com" target=new>AutoTruckData.com</a>\r<p><p>An interference engine is an engine design that has been avoided by some manufacturers for well over 80 years. General Motors, Chrysler, etc., typically use a metal chain-type timing belt on push-rod engines (often called a timing chain) to transmit torque from the engine crankshaft o the engine camshaft that opens the valves that admit air and fuel. (Note: on some new cars the fuel is admitted not through the valves but through injectors in the top of the cylinder. Rather than use a steel timing chain, interference engines may use a rubber timing belt with its limited life, whereas steel timing belts typically last 150,000 to 200,000 miles or more.\r<p><p>Valves open further in an interference engine and project further into the combustion chamber than in a ''free-running'' engine. This allows outside air at atmospheric pressure flow faster into the combustion chamber through the larger valve opening. The engine can therefore inhale more air, be a little smaller, and still create as much power while reducing its manufactured cost and also guaranteeing future repair business for its dealer. If a rubber timing belt breaks by not being replaced soon enough, some of the valves stuck in their open position will collide with the top of the pistons, thereby breaking or irreversibly damaging one or the other or both. To make matters worse, it is not possible to measure the wear on such a rubber belt so that it could be replaced when there is some indication of imminent failure. Failure in these belts is catastrophic, without warning. This will require a whole new engine be installed. Woe to the owner. Finally, the rubber belt may have to be replaced long before 60,000 miles solely due to its age. This is really playing a bad poker hand. Interference engines are like a time bomb waiting to explode unless replacing the timing belt at the recommended interval. Be aware of that guaranteed future expense before buying a new car, or especially a used car, " with such an engine.\r<p><p>For details on this subject or for recommended mileage to replace rubber timing belts on interference engines, connect on the Internet to ©Gates Rubber Company, a worldwide manufacturer of such belts. When its web site appears, click on Replacement parts/Automotive. Look for ''Timing belt replacement Guide''.\r<p><p>When buying a used car always insist on determining if the vehicle has a rubber timing-belt. Be aware that about five years ago an International Oil Company did a follow up on 5,000 cars it had turned back after 3 year leases and traced them to their eventual private owners. All the cars had by then passed through wholesale auction markets and likely one or more retail dealers before being sold to a private owner. The survey disclosed that 50% of the cars had their odometers illegally turned back.\r<p><p>When buying a used car, supposedly with 40,000 miles for example, and determining it has a rubber timing belt, insist on a written guarantee from the seller to guarantee in writing to replace the timing belt at no charge if it fails within another 20,000 miles, a typical recommended total amount (call any Dealer to get the recommended amount for the particular make of vehicle). After all, the vehicle may in fact already have 55,000 miles on it. If the seller will not make that guarantee, then he is admitting that the mileage is probably not accurate and by implication may well have been turned back. If the seller will not make that guarantee, consider a compromise, such as $100 maximum cost. If not acceptable, walk away and look elsewhere."\r<p><p>Before buying any car, especially 4-cylinder foreign cars, or even 6-cyl. BMW’s, be aware of the unavoidable cost of $400-$800 to replace the timing belt at anywhere from 50,000 to 70,000 miles if the car has an interference type of engine. The sales person will invariably not mention that an interference type engine powers the vehicle and may not even know what one is. If a timing belt on an interference engine is not replaced at recommended intervals, the repair cost when the belt breaks (not gradually, but always catastrophically) could increase to $3,000 to $5,000 due to engine failure because parts have smashed into each other\r<p><p>If the sales person does not know if the vehicle has an interference engine, walk out to the repair shop and ask the ''Service writer'', who is probably a former mechanic. Finally, since words are cheap, write on the purchase order that the seller guarantees the engine is not a "interference engine" and will indemnify you 100% if it turns out that it is and the engine breaks when the rubber timing belt breaks.\r<p><p>Copyright 2004 by Beacon Data LLC All rights reserved\r<p><p><p><p><p><table width=100% cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 border=0 bgcolor=#dddddd><p><tr><td><p><p><b>About The Author</b><br><p>\r<p><p>Ralph Hoffmann majored in Applied Mathematics at the Univ. of Wisconsin, but worked largely in machine tool manufacturing.

For example, you need to contact car clubs to display vintage cars well in advance of the show date. This becomes your time-line.\r<p><p>When the show day arrives, it will be easier to execute the plan because it was projected in phases. Another example, if you have five teams, divide the project outline among them. Each team will be responsible for its section and meeting the time-line.\r<p><p>Although you are planning your car show to be executed in phases, it is critical to have contingencies in place. In other words: a backup plan to allow for worst-case scenarios such as someone dropping the ball or an unreliable vendor. This does not mean you need to worry about every little negative thing or plan for the worst.\r<p><p>No one can plan for the unknown but when things don’t go as planned, roll with it because it’s show time—and it is a beautiful thing when a plan comes together.

Planning a car show does not have to be difficult.

It is equally important that it be someone whom sponsors and vendors can relate to as well.  Since the next logical step is to form committees, the lead person must be well liked and respected.  Selecting an event director should not be ignored nor taken lightly.  The structure and success of the car show requires it.\r<p><p>Avoid Chaos\r<p><p>Don’t expect to let the group lead because you will have a mass of confusion.  The plan should be discussed with the group to get their input and to finalize the plan.\r<p><p>Usually, the person whose idea it is to have a car show becomes the leader.  They either already know how to execute a show or needs to consult articles such as this to get started.\r<p><p>Pick the best person to keep it all together and represent the organization and car show.

Here’s an example. A sponsor is an individual or corporation who donates free products and services to your event.\r<p><p>No Free Lunch\r<p><p>Some sponsors donate money but that is rarely the case. Although you do not have to pay for the incentives they provide, there is no free lunch. Sponsors usually require advertising of their brand in exchange for their assistance. This is only fair since they are saving you a lot of out-of-pocket money.\r<p><p>Even large car shows take advantage of sponsorships. So it is definitely to your advantage to seek them as well. It could make the difference when there is no money in the budget for prizes and giveaway merchandise.\r<p><p>Developing a relationship with sponsors has mutual benefits. However, it is recommended that you approach potential sponsors that cater to your event visitors. In this case, they are more likely to respond favorably to your request.\r<p><p>You Got Homework\r<p><p>Do your research to determine the type of incentives a sponsor may be willing to contribute before you ask. The merchandise request needs to be related to the event. For example, golf clubs are not related to a car show but a set of tires would get you rolling in the right direction. Be very professional when you contact a potential sponsor. Give them enough lead-time to respond and don’t forget to thank them regardless.\r<p><p>If you have never solicited a sponsorship, contact people who have—to get ideas about submitting requests, etc. This is an area that requires good written and oral communication skills but don’t let that scare you. Again, ask for volunteers. There is usually someone in the group who can accomplish this task—and you will be glad they did.\r<p><p><p><p><p><table width=100% cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 border=0 bgcolor=#dddddd><p><tr><td><p><p><b>About The Author</b><br><p>\r<p><p>Tonza Borden is the developer and administrator of <a href="http://AtlantaAntiqueCarClub.com" target=new>AtlantaAntiqueCarClub.com</a>.

Another option is contributing a donation to a nonprofit car club for their service.\r<p><p>Main Attraction\r<p><p>These beautiful motorcars are show quality. So having a contact with a car club is essential. Individual clubs have different rules and regulations for displaying cars. If you are planning a classic car attraction, you should contact the car club as soon as you decide that you want to have a car show. Time is of the essence to work out the details, and get on their calendar, in the car show season. Prepare questions prior to making the call to appear organized and save time. Some frequently asked questions are:\r<p><ul>\r<p>	<li>What is the donation amount for your service?\r<p>	<li>How long can the cars be exhibited?\r<p>	<li>How many cars will you bring?\r<p></ul>\r<p><p>A car show requires a large venue with sections for exhibitors, vendors and visitors parking.

We know for a fact that it’s not only for the sake of transportation but also for a little satisfaction of our vanity – seeing everyone admire us, atop an excellent piece of machine. Like any road going vehicle, a motorcycle''s performance is based on the smooth running of thousands of parts, large and small. It is a nuisance indeed to find some faulty parts on a vehicle and prevent owners from enjoying its full use. \r<p><p>Broken parts on a motorcycle can spell tragedy for its driver and extensive damage to the machine. In a motorcycle, the safety and security provided by a four wheel vehicle on each corner doesn''t exist as such, when its rear wheel locks up at 70 mph it could skid out of control and throw its rider. What’s more heartbreaking is to know that the cause of the accident is because of a broken part.\r<p><p>The best solution is to always have a replacement part handy in order to have extra parts for those which have been damaged or lost. Having ample budget for this would, however run risks for your pocket. If you do not have sufficient budget to afford the high costs of brand new replacement parts but afraid of scratching around for used motorcycle parts from questionable origins and warranty, don’t fret. There’s still a way for you to save money by buying used motorcycle parts and prevent you from living your worst nightmare. \r<p><p>Yes, indeed! Buying used motorcycle parts are a great way for you to save money and keep your bike going splendidly. There are just some pointers or guidelines for you to remember once you have decided that your budget leaves you little choice between brand new and used motorcycle parts. By following several general guidelines, you could still acquire used motorcycle parts that are in tip top shape, good condition and will not be the cause of your bike getting torn apart. \r<p><p>First of all, when scouting for used motorcycle parts, especially online, make a point to double – check, there are things to look out for, consider and avoid. Don’t ever miss out on crucial details, like, how old can the used part be? How compatible will it be to your bike’s model and make? Next, it is understandable to be skeptical, after all, the World Wide Web is full of BS and scams. You have to be careful to avoid those who make stupid claims that expect you to believe them. It is but your right to verify and countercheck the validity of everything that they are offering you and once you have placed an order, as much as possible, give certain conditions for your purchase. Something that may go like, they will have to show you if the purchased part functions upon getting secured on your bike. You could also inquire for warranty periods. \r<p><p>There are ways to save your money and still get above-average used motorcycle parts.

(42, 'The Most Important Accessory For Your Sports Bike', '<b>The Most Important Accessory For Your Sports Bike</b><br><p>&nbsp;by: <b>Granny''s Mettle</b><p><p>\r<p><p>When it comes to accessorizing, riders and owners of motorcycles, particularly those that are new in this field, often spend their money in increasing engine performance. Oftentimes, they put their entire budget on performance motorcycle parts accessories like exhausts, fuel injection, mapping systems, and other components to help boost the motorcycle''s engine.\r<p><p>But once they experience track riding, the illusion of power as the most important component to gain speed fades fast. In fact, too much of it without taking into consideration the other factors may just make your motorcycle more than you can handle. Many have experienced that it could actually make one slower than the others with less powerful bikes.\r<p><p>So what performance motorcycle parts accessories should you invest in? Here are some suggestions of expert riders of motorcycles:\r<p><p>•	Suspension\r<p><p>Lance Keigwin of Star Motorcycle School and Hare Racing, suggests that riders should take full note of the suspension. This is one component that can increase speed in motorcycles, according to Keigwin. Unfortunately, most riders often overlook this factor. He further explained that some of the stock bikes today may perform under regular conditions; however, when pushed beyond the average riding situations, their performance becomes questionable. "I do not suggest, however, that you spend a fortune in full suspension components; instead, I suggest you work with your stock suspension and use components that may improve the stock equipment like the gold valve emulators," Keigwin added. \r<p><p>•	Tires\r<p><p>According to Keigwin, tires are another important component when it comes to handling motorcycles. "Simple knowledge of how the different types of tires help maneuverability may also help you be a faster and smoother rider," he suggests.\r<p><p>Keigwin further suggests reducing weight from unsprung parts such as wheels, rotors, sprockets and engine parts. He said that this technique helps in handling the motorcycle better. His opinion is that some of the weight of the components may create the effect that makes the motorcycle go straight. However, by installing lighter components, according to Keigwin, helps in improving considerably the handling of the motorcycle. For him, "Power is almost at the end of my list of priorities; right before cosmetics."\r<p><p>•	Handling factor\r<p><p>The handling factor also comes as a priority above power and cosmetics. This is according to Alex Florea of AFMotorsports. Florea said that to an average rider, several things may not be so visible. This includes installing taller tires without adjusting the geometry. This may cause riders to loose stability and may need to adjust the triple clamps on the forks to make up for the difference. With regards to slicks, he suggests that DOT tires are better investments.  \r<p><p><p><p><p><table width=100% cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 border=0 bgcolor=#dddddd><p><tr><td><p><p><b>About The Author</b><br><p>\r<p><p>Granny''s Mettle is a 30-something, professional web content writer.

They are capable of the same speeds as cars and can also be licensed for use on public highways.\r<p><p>Owners and drivers of motorcycles opt for these motorized, two-wheeled vehicles as transportation because aside from it being an inexpensive alternative to cars, they can be easily maneuvered and they deliver higher fuel economy. In addition, they take less space for parking. No wonder a lot of Asian countries have more motorcycles than cars.\r<p><p>And for drivers who love speed, motorcycles are great vehicles because they can accelerate more quickly than an automobile. Nevertheless, motorcycles are not for everybody. Riding and controlling this vehicle requires skill and extra caution especially during difficult maneuverings on wet or slick surfaces.\r<p><p>But when you do get the urge to ride a motorcycle, you would want to learn a lot of information on the vehicle, like "Where do I start?"; "How do I start my motorcycle?"; "Do I need to shift gears?" "If so, how do I do it?" And most of all, any beginner would want to know first the makings and basic parts of a motorcycle and how they work. \r<p><p>One author wrote that to give steps on how to start a motorcycle on a hill involves a tremendous number of motorcycle parts.

Other than the tires, the body, the most well known part I believe is the muffler. The motorcycle muffler includes all pipes and baffles needed to reduce, if not quiet, the exhaust noise. It is also used to match with the carburetor jetting. Most often than not, factory mufflers are changed to aftermarket pipes to tailor to the specifications of the user according to sound and performance. \r<p><p>However, not all motorcycles have the same parts in the same places. Each motorcycle, whether they have aftermarket motorcycle parts or OEM, has its own names for its parts and even the way that the parts are interconnected may be different.

For obvious reasons - to get a visible, tangible look at a design before production so its feel can be evaluated, possible problems can be foreseen, and, for concept cars shown to the public, so reactions of non-gear heads can be judged.\r<p><p>In testing particular ideas concepts are best - for example, they could be a test bed for exterior and interior colors and materials, new controls and dashboard layouts, variations on packaging, etc. \r<p><p>Driving concept cars is a wonderful experience knowing you have driven a future car first hand. Designs that you can only see in futuristic movies become suddenly real and many are exaggerated versions of what will actually appear.\r<p><p>The Jeep? Gladiator Concept Car features the historic box side-mounted spare of past models as well as an open-air canvas top, an expandable truck bed and a stowaway rear seat cushion, has a rugged functionality only found in Jeep. The engine is a 2.8-liter diesel ideal for off-roading yet environmentally friendly, since gas mileage of diesels is better and don''t pollute like those of years past. \r<p><p>It can presumably also be run on biodiesel, which both reduces the amount of energy spent on processing and avoids toxic spills. The engine has an abundant 295 foot-pounds of torque and 163 horsepower. \r<p><p>The short rear overhang allows a good departure angle for off-roading. There is a solid front axle, and in the rear, a trailing arm system with coil-within-a-coil. There are a front winch, front and rear locking differentials, and skid plates. On the driver''s side, there is a cabin storage access panel, and a lockable storage box in front of the rear wheel where the jack is stowed.\r<p><p>The Gladiator looks like the shape of Wranglers to come, and rumor has it that''s exactly what it is: a first try at getting the dimensions and shape of the next-generation Wrangler, due around 2006 (partly to meet new safety standards). We''ve been told that the Gladiator retains the classic Jeep live axles, with a similar 4x4 system and length, but with more width for better stability and comfort (the Gladiator is ten inches wider, but we suspect the actual increase will be half that). The suspension will be updated for additional capacity and safety, and we suspect some electronics will be thrown into the mix. If the Gladiator is any indication, ground clearance will also be considerably better - which will be helpful given the new competition from Hummers, Porsches, and the like.\r<p><p>The most notable feaature for the enthusiast is a new take on the midgate concept. The cab''s rear window rolls down into its divider, but, according to credible rumor, the seats then fold and tumble under the pickup bed, so that the bed itself is effectively six feet, eight inches long, extending into the cab. This is rather different from the Avalanche/Sport Trak setup.\r<p><p>It was heard that there will be four doors, but the two rear doors will be partial-width - a suicide door on the passenger side for easier entry into the back seats, and, cleverly, a smaller door on the driver''s side.\r<p><p>For all of your Jeep parts needs browse through <a href="http://www.partstrain.com/ShopByVehicle/JEEP" target=new>http://www.partstrain.com/ShopByVehicle/JEEP</a> and avail of top of the line Jeep parts that are excellent deals.

Public viewing of the 2006 Lexus RX400 in early 2005 reveals combined fuel efficiency in the range of the current EPA average rating for a four- cylinder compact sedan. The RX400h will be a SULEV rated vehicle which means driving from Los Angeles to New York and back nine times (54,000 miles) yet produce less- smog forming emissions.\r<p><p>The 2006 Lexus RX400h combines 3.3 liter V6 gasoline engine with two electric drive motors: a strong 120 kW (161 horsepower) motor positioned near the rear wheels. The new Hybrid System will deliver a peak output of 270 horsepower with a 20% increase compared to the non-hybrid RX330 power train. Much more impressive is the 30-50 mph passing acceleration of the high output electric motor that delivers a high burst of torque.\r<p><p>Future Toyota Hybrid Synergy Drives hold the potential to operate even more efficiently using new types of batteries and fuels. According to Fujio Cho, President of Toyota Motor Corporation " Toyota''s Hybrid System will make up the heart of our hydrogen fuel cell program of tomorrow".\r<p><p>The advantage of a hybrid driveline is that it eliminates hardships associated with electric cars to provide breakthrough performance, exemplary fuel efficiency, very low exhaust emissions, and a high level of convenience.\r<p><p>2006 Lexus RX400h introduces a new era of enhanced performance dimension to the widely known hybrid advantages of excellent fuel mileage and low emissions. The RX 400h will be rated as a Super Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (SULEV) in California (Tier 2 – Bin 3 in other states), one of the most stringent emissions ratings in the industry.\r<p><p>The Lexus RX 400h is defined as a "full hybrid," which means that it is capable of operating in electric-only or gas engine-only mode as well as a mode that combines the power of the gas engine and electric motor. In contrast, other hybrid technologies are not capable of running only on electrical power, but instead require constant gas engine operation.\r<p><p>In making the transition to a hybrid power train, the alternator, power steering pump, water pump and AC compressor are no longer engine belt-driven. This is because the gas engine often shuts down—a fuel-saving benefit of the hybrid system—especially when the vehicle is stopped or driven slowly through traffic. Except for the alternator, which is replaced by motor-generators, all components are now electrically powered which means notably lower parasitic losses to the engine and improved fuel consumption.\r<p><p>The Lexus hybrid technology also allows extended electric-mode operation during low speed or stop-and-go driving conditions. The permanent-magnet front electric drive motor (MG2) produces peak torque from zero-to-1,500 RPM, giving the RX 400h powerful and instantaneous response that will be especially felt and appreciated in low- and mid-speed performance and in merging and passing maneuvers.\r<p><p>A regenerative braking system further boosts system efficiency. When the RX 400h is coasting or the brakes are applied, the electric motors function as generators, capturing kinetic energy that would normally be lost as heat through the brakes and transforming it into useable electricity to recharge the batteries. \r<p><p>With the RX 400h, Lexus also introduces a new generation of vehicle stability control systems known as Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM). A vital component of VDIM is a new Electronically Controlled Braking system (ECB). The ECB system translates brake pedal stroke speed and pressure and generates the precise amount of combined electric regeneration and hydraulic pressure needed for virtually any driving condition. \r<p><p>VDIM allows more optimized operation of the vehicle''s dynamic handling systems that employ the brakes: ABS, Brake Assist, Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) and traction control (TRAC). VDIM also interfaces with the Electronic Throttle Control system, allowing it to modify vehicle power when needed, and a new Electronic Power Steering system (EPS) to optimize steering assist for each situation.\r<p><p>When the RX 400h is coasting or the brakes are applied, the electric motors function as generators, capturing kinetic energy that would normally be lost as heat through the brakes and transforming it into useable electricity to recharge the batteries.

Ask yourself this first.\r<p><p>Why do we customize and add accessories to our Harley?\r<p><p>Well, for me it''s simple!\r<p><p>We want to stand out above all else!  The last thing we want is to look like every Tom, Dick, and Harry out there on the road!\r<p><p>You may have different reasons.  You may want to add an Accessory to your bike because it fits with you and your taste.\r<p><p>There is an element of being practical as well.  If you install a nice chrome luggage rack on your back fender, or a detachable windshield, it not only looks good but it also serves a purpose.  How else would you carry your tent and keep bugs out of your teeth?\r<p><p>Not everyone has the same taste in customizing.  Thank God for that, or it sure would be boring taking a walk down on main street in Sturgis South Dakota during the 1st week of August.\r<p><p>Some people go overboard on customizing their bike.  Overboard for someone may be a masterpiece for someone else.  It all depends on who you are and what you''re about.\r<p><p>How do you pick out a Harley Davidson Accessory or decide on customizing?\r<p><p>It''s a hard question to answer.\r<p><p>I would suggest that you decide on what you want out of your bike.  Sit back and have a look at yourself.  What kind of biker are you anyway?\r<p><p>Are you a speed demon that likes to lay rubber on the road every now and then.  Do you get a kick out of doing a little showing off at bike rallies to friends and family?  Do you like to participate in show and shine contests?\r<p><p>If you are this person you may want to look at getting your engine rebuilt for increased horsepower.  You can''t go wrong with a lot of Harley chrome either.  Just when you think you have had enough of chrome, you find some more in that catalog.\r<p><p>Don''t worry, there is a chrome Harley Davidson motorcycle built to date.\r<p><p>Your style may be a little more subdued.  Your main motorcycling purpose in life may be ride the road and not waste time with anything else.  You would have to agree, most people still want to look good riding a Harley.\r<p><p>If you are this person you may only want one or two Accessories.  A nice luggage bag that slips over that backrest on your bike looks good when you are on a long trip and it serves a purpose.\r<p><p>Every Harley Davidson owner at some time or another has thought about adding an accessory to his or her motorcycle.  You rarely see a stock Harley Davidson!\r<p><p>Keep in mind the kind of person you are when making Harley Davidson Accessory choices.

Remember to take into consideration additional costs such as title, tax, registration, insurance, and additional costs. In most cases when you are going to finance the vehicle, it is best to get preapproved so that you will know how much you can spend. Other questions to ask yourself are:\r<p><p>How much can you put down as a down payment?\r<p><br>How much can you afford to pay in monthly payments?\r<p><p>Step #3 : Will You Buy the Vehicle or Lease It?\r<p><p>Deciding on whether to buy or lease your vehicle is an important decision. If you plan on keeping the vehicle once it is paid off, then you will want to buy the vehicle. On the other hand, if you just wish to drive the vehicle and not obtain ownership, then you may want to just lease the vehicle. Normally the price for leasing a vehicle is considerably less than purchasing the vehicle, since you are just leasing the right to drive it.\r<p><p>Step #4 : Decide on Which Vehicles You Wish to Consider\r<p><p>This is the time when you want to pick out the makes and models of the vehicles you are considering. By answering the questions listed in step #1, you should have some idea of which vehicles you wish to consider.\r<p><p>Step #5 : Find the Vehicles\r<p><p>Visit <a href="http://www.autopixal.com/buy/" target=new>http://www.autopixal.com/buy/</a> and find the vehicles you are interested in. Be sure to select the correct distance, price, and year of the vehicles you are interested in.\r<p><p>Step #6 : Research the Vehicles\r<p><p>Compare the prices of similar vehicles. Use our website to find other vehicles that may not be within the distance you selected, but have the same options you selected. Use the articles under the research section to find additional information to help assist you in your decision.\r<p><p>Step #7 : Find the Market Value of the Vehicles\r<p><p>Use the market value tools at <a href="http://www.autopixal.com/research/vehiclevalue/" target=new>http://www.autopixal.com/research/vehiclevalue/</a> to find the market value of the vehicles you are considering. By finding the market value, you can use that to your advantage in negotiating the price.\r<p><p>Step #8 : Schedule a Test Drive\r<p><p>Contact the seller and schedule a test drive. When taking the vehicle for a test drive, be sure to take the vehicle into different driving conditions. The Interstate or Downtown are two places in which you may want to drive the vehicle. Also be sure to listen for vibrations or noises caused by the vehicle while driving.\r<p><p>Step #9 : Negotiate the Price\r<p><p>Inspect the vehicle to see if you can find any additional elements that you can use in your negotiations. Small problems can serve to your advantage when they are presented. Take into consideration any problems you may have found while driving or inspecting the vehicle, and the market value of the vehicle when deciding on a price. Don''t jump the gun with your offer. Give the seller time to consider the fact that you may not be too interested in the vehicle and the seller may lower the price in hopes of closing the deal.\r<p><p>Step #10 : Close the Deal\r<p><p>Find out any information you may need to know about the vehicle from the seller. Contact your insurance provider, or use the Insurance section of our website, along with the Vin# from the vehicle in order to obtain insurance for your vehicle. Then transfer the title and register the vehicle in your name. Depending on your state''s laws, the requirements for buying a vehicle may vary.

(52, 'Proper Installation Of Used Motorcycle Cables', '<b>Proper Installation Of Used Motorcycle Cables</b><br><p>&nbsp;by: <b>Granny''s Mettle</b><p><p>\r<p><p>Part and parcel of owning a bike is maintaining its appearance and its capability. Nevertheless, despite making sure that the parts and cables of the motorcycle give us maximum service, we cannot but accept that they have their own warranties and lifetimes. \r<p><p>Unlike artwork or antiques, motorcycles are made to be used and abused. With all the elements found in the environment, motorcycle parts will definitely have its final day. When that day comes and you don''t have enough money to buy new ones, why not settle for used motorcycle parts, e.g. cables? With a few tinkering and proper installation, they might just provide you the service you need in many years to come.\r<p><p>Here are some suggestions for proper installation of used motorcycle parts and cables:\r<p><p>Tip #1: Inspect and make sure you have the correct cable. This is the very first step in getting the best used cable you need. Inspect the used cable for any major wear and tear. Remember that these are used cables so it will definitely have a few scratches; but it must not be too great that using it for just a few days will result in a total bust. After you have checked thoroughly, make sure you have the correct part for the application, e.g. correct cable ends, proper size casing ferrules, correct size, shape and thread size of adjusters/elbows, etc.\r<p><p>Tip #2: Make sure all adjusters are in "closed" position.\r<p><p>Tip #3: Use a direct route for the cables. Route your used cables from control to actuator in the most direct way possible. Keep cables away from hot surfaces and avoid sharp bends, as well as "kinks" in the housing or inner cable.\r<p><p>Tip #4: Adjust throttle/idle cables. These should be adjusted the carb/s will return to full close when off. Adjust any excessive freeplay and be sure throttle action is smooth and free from open to full close before starting the engine. Also make sure that the used cables do not bind together or hang up when there is full lock-to-lock movement of bars.\r<p><p>Tip #5: Make sure clutch/brake cables are routed properly. This is to avoid binding or hanging up the cables when there is full lock-to-lock movement of bars. Also, cables that are routed properly will not bind during compression of forks or suspension. Install lever and actuator fittings, adjust freeplay to correct specs and check for smooth-positive action. These are done before starting the bike.\r<p><p>Tip #6: Route the speedometer/tachometer cables using a direct path. Make sure that the cable will not hang up on the caliper when forks compressed on the front wheel drive speedometer cable. This is what usually happens with aftermarket calipers because they often come in a larger size or different shape. Always make sure that the inner cable is well-lubed with light grease when installing and removing. Clean and re-grease regularly for maintenance.  \r<p><p>Tip #7: Avoid having contact with painted surfaces when installing stainless steel braided cables. The braided surfaces of these used cables are very abrasive. You can use shrink or spiral wrap and/or cable guides when needed. And because stainless braided cables are less flexible, always keep this in mind when getting measurements for applications that are tailored according to your specifications. Clean and lube like any conventional cable assemblies.\r<p><p>And like any other used motorcycle parts, keep used cables clean and properly lubricated when necessary. Always check on the proper adjustments and inspect for any wear and tear on a regular basis. Signs to look out for are torn or worn housing, frayed wires, and signs of bending or kinking at the controls. \r<p><p><p><p><p><table width=100% cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 border=0 bgcolor=#dddddd><p><tr><td><p><p><b>About The Author</b><br><p>\r<p><p>Granny''s Mettle is a 30-something, professional web content writer.

(53, 'Keeping Used Motorcycle Parts As Good As New', '<b>Keeping Used Motorcycle Parts As Good As New</b><br><p>&nbsp;by: <b>Granny''s Mettle</b><p><p>\r<p><p>Even with regular maintenance and upkeep, our motorcycles tend to get used and subjected to different elements in the environment. To keep used motorcycle parts as good as the day when we first bought them, regular washing and rinsing will do the trick. \r<p><p>But you should take note how you do your washing. You might scratch parts of your motorcycle.\r<p><p>Top Rule: Avoid scratches.\r<p><p>Scratches are the biggest enemy of any bike''s finish. The secret of keeping your used motorcycle parts as good as new is to avoid scratches in your motorcycle. Dirt and grime when rubbed in while washing or drying, act as sandpaper and will definitely dull the brilliance of your bike''s paint. \r<p><p>To avoid scratching your bike, first, you need to remember that anything that comes in contact with your motorcycle''s finish should be made of soft material. Take care that no harsh or rough surfaces will be able to connect with any part of your motorcycle. Zippers are the worst offenders.\r<p><p>Use only clean, freshly washed cotton cloths or towels to dry your bike after washing. When you need to put on any application to make your bike shine, again use the clean cotton cloths and towels. Rinse thoroughly the sponges or wash mitts, as well as the bucket, before and after washing your bike to remove any dirt or grime. \r<p><p>One of the best advice I got from a used motorcycle parts site was to separate my bike''s areas into normal and rough areas when washing. I usually consider the painted surfaces as normal areas, while the tires, engine, and inner fenders are the rough areas. I use different wash mitts and sponges for each area to keep dirt and grime away from the sensitive areas. This way, scratching would be avoided.\r<p><p>Use also a gentle stream of water when rinsing, rather than high water pressure that comes from the hose. The high pressure of water will cause dirt to grind further into the paint, causing scratches along with other worse problems. And remember to use generous amounts of water when rinsing. Dirt that causes scratch will easily float away with enough water used. \r<p><p>When washing your bike…\r<p><p>Use lots of water, but without the high pressure. Totally avoid using pressure washers. Instead let the water flow freely by detaching the nozzle from the hose. \r<p><p>Along with the generous amount of water, use detergents designed specifically for motorcycle washing. Ordinary detergent tends to remove the wax that we want to try to keep. Simply mix the detergent according to the directions and go for it. Just make sure you rinse each section soon after applying the detergent so that no soap film will develop. It is difficult to get rid of the soap film when it dries up.\r<p><p>After washing, rinse, rinse, and rinse some more. Rinse everywhere. Every nook and cranny should be rinsed of soap. \r<p><p>Lastly, wash your motorcycle without bright sunlight. Soap suds can easily dry from the heat. Ideal time of the day would be in the late afternoon or early morning when the sun is not so strong. \r<p><p><p><p><p><table width=100% cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 border=0 bgcolor=#dddddd><p><tr><td><p><p><b>About The Author</b><br><p>\r<p><p>Granny''s Mettle is a 30-something, professional web content writer.

(54, 'Install a Rev Counter on your Motorcycle', '<b>Install a Rev Counter on your Motorcycle</b><br><p>&nbsp;by: <b>Granny''s Mettle</b><p><p>\r<p><p>The tachometer or the rev counter tells how much the speed of the engine of the motorcycle revolutions per minute (RPM). Common nowadays are electronic rev counters that can be installed by the dealers you get them from. But for used motorcycle parts, rev counters usually come in just any wrapping without instructions or diagrams. In cases like these, you may install your rev counter with the following instructions to help you. \r<p><p>The very first step is to move the headlight away. This is a great help later on in avoiding some mistakes and will definitely help you finish faster. If you feel a little hesitant in removing your headlight, you might prefer to just let it dangle by the wire. Just make sure that wire can handle your headlight''s weight. \r<p><p>Then take the side pin out of the speedometer. Remove the two allen screws from the back of the speedometer and keep all the parts. I kept mine in a coffee mug and was able to account for all of them when I was putting everything back. Slide the speedo canister down the speedo cable with a good pair of pliers to loosen the cable.\r<p><p>Notice the two wires on the back of the speedo. Remove the speedo. To easily remove, lubricate the speedo then twist it out of the rubber grommet that holds it in the mounting plate.\r<p><p>At the front of the mounting plate you will see three allens. Remove the allens and hold the horizontal black plastic light pod on. Then remove the two allens that hold the mounting plate on the chassis.\r<p><p>At the back of the speedo, there are two screws that will allow you to twist the fitting where the cable screws are on. Loosen them just enough to allow you to twist the fitting as little as possible and with some resistance. \r<p><p>Then there are two "light housings" that contain three indicator lights each. Jot down the wire color combinations. This information will become handy later on. Afterwhich, you have to remove the indicator lights from the housing. Then take out all the used motorcycle parts of the rev counter.\r<p><p>Run the indicator lights in the new black plastic T-shaped Light Housing. Lubricate the little rubber receptacles and twist them a little. This should form a T when you look at it from the front. \r<p><p>Then install next either the light cluster or the speedo. If you decide to install the light cluster first, then it’s the rear chrome cover second, then the black plastic T housing, then the plastic indicator plate, then the foam rubber gasket, and finally the front chrome cover.\r<p><p>Next, install the tachometer. Get the rubber grommet in the hole on the right which you can easily see as you look at the front of the face plate. Lube the housing, rotate and wiggle it into the grommet. Then install the wires. The yellow wire, for light, goes in the hole at the back that the bulb pushes into. Black wire, for ground goes to the terminal marked (-), while the red/black goes to the (+). The yellow/black goes to the terminal between the ground and +12 volt terminals. Another black wire which has a covered end is the ring connector. Put it on one of the studs at the back of the rev counter. This is for the light in your tachometer.\r<p><p>Just a few screws to tighten and knots to bolt and you''re done. Easy isn''t it?\r<p><p><p><p><p><table width=100% cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 border=0 bgcolor=#dddddd><p><tr><td><p><p><b>About The Author</b><br><p>\r<p><p>Granny''s Mettle is a 30-something, professional web content writer.

When to buy an OEM or aftermarket motorcycle parts can be very difficult to determine.\r<p><p>But what are OEM parts, you ask. And what about aftermarket?\r<p><p>Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) parts\r<p><p>These are the genuine parts found at an authorized distributor of your brand of motorcycle. They are usually considered as originals because they have the exact same specifications that came with the original part. They are generally more expensive and almost always recommended by dealers because of the higher income they''ll get selling OEM parts. Hence, they will always tell you that OEM parts are of the higher quality.\r<p><p>But this may not be true due to the fact that the parts are not necessarily produced by the original manufacturers themselves. Many motorcycle and automobile manufacturers nowadays often have the parts designed and made outside by independent companies. Afterwhich the motorcycle manufacturers install them in their machines or put them in their own boxes to be sold as OEM parts.\r<p><p>Aftermarket motorcycle parts\r<p><p>Aftermarket motorcycle parts, on the hand, are those that are produced by companies other than the original manufacturers. These are generally cheaper than the OEM parts but have the same performance.\r<p><p>Sometimes, after a certain period of time, the original manufacturer will allow the aftermarket motorcycle parts to be sold in their own packaging but at a reduced price. The part now becomes an aftermarket OEM part.\r<p><p>At times when the original manufacturer allows the company that physically produced the part to sell it at a reduced price and in their own packaging, the part now becomes an OEM aftermarket part. \r<p><p>There''s a lot of competition out there that''s why many aftermarket motorcycle parts may come up as OEM parts. You just need to look closely and hunt for the part that you need according to your budget. If you think that you cannot find the quality you are looking for in an aftermarket part, then search for the OEM, if you can afford it.\r<p><p>All in all, it really depends on what you''re looking for. You need to consider where you''re going to use the motorcycle parts--- for replacement or improvement. You also have to consider other factors such as the availability of the part, your budget and others. All of these will help you decide to either go for OEM or aftermarket motorcycle parts.

Planning your car show event is not an easy task but the process can be simplified and efficient.  The most important steps to planning your extravaganza are as follows:\r<p><p>The Organizers\r<p><p>You can be the sole show organizer or it can be a joint venture with another group.  Whichever way you decide to go, there is a lot of face-to-face coordination involved.  Also, it may be inconvenient to get everybody to together at a meeting on the same day.  But you will need to make sure that everybody knows what’s going on and be reminded of their role and responsibilities.  You’re probably wondering how to accomplish that because coordinating people is a major feat itself.  Here’s where Atlanta Antique Car Club comes in with those hard-to-find resources.  We recommend staying in contact with helloWorld – Video e-Mail.  It is easy, affordable and so much better than phoning.  \r<p><p>The Event\r<p><p>Plan a car show with a fun and festive atmosphere for the whole family.  Plan a luxury and performance car and bike event dedicated to the automobile industry – featuring the best possible cars, motorcycles, limousines, customs, and art cars available because this is the “attraction”.  Varying your selection of automobiles and automotive products is what will give your show the extravagant factor and take it over the top.    \r<p><p>The Venue\r<p><p>Location, location, location.  This is where your show will go down in history. Because of the nature of your event, selecting a venue that is unique is very important.  It must have an acceptable floor plan to accommodate a large crowd, registration, bathrooms, many exhibitors and vendors, and ample parking spaces for visitors and show car trailers.\r<p><p>The Theme\r<p><p>Classic cars, food and old music are the right formula for an old-school theme and goodtime.  Dressing in period clothing can add nostalgia and interest, too.  And, when the 50’s music starts, your visitors will be taking a trip down memory lane.  Check out this 50s party in a box to get your creative juices flowing.\r<p><p>The Attraction\r<p><p>If this is your main event of the year, it should be a festive “extravaganza” representing a vintage and classic car lifestyle.  Whether it is one day or held over a few days, it should have a dramatic theme to set the stage for beautiful motorcars and beautiful people.  Your car show should be the hottest ticket in town – not the most boring.  So pull out all of the stops and go for it!\r<p><p>The Multi-Task Team Building\r<p><p>The people behind your car show are a very important component – especially the creative team.  Here’s a tip that will pay dividends.  Keep all of your volunteers happy because they comprise the logistical teams to perform the multi-tasks, at no cost.  That being said, the creative team is responsible for planning the theme and working with the committees to get it done, under budget and on time. \r<p><p>The Vendors or Us\r<p><p>Buying, cooking and selling foodstuff has its advantages.  On the other hand, your event may be so huge that you won’t have enough hands to flip burgers quick enough.  Inviting vendors is a good thing as long as they:\r<p><ul>\r<p>	<li>Carry insurance\r<p>	<li>Be liable and on-time\r<p>	<li>Be very professional\r<p></ul>\r<p><p>The Fundraising\r<p><p>Make your car show extravaganza make money – without spending a lot. How? Use your church parking lot or a donated venue.  Be your own vendor by cooking and selling food and beverage – that’s donated or bought at discount prices.  What you spend upfront will make a big difference on your bottom line.  Sell tickets for a raffle, special attraction, etc.  Charge a small fee for parking lot spaces for swap meet vendors.  Or, collect donated sale items from your members for 100% profit.  Ask for donated folding tables as well as monetary donations (if you are a nonprofit organization).  Write and publish FREE public service announcements to announce your event – giving them at least two weeks lead-time.  Tell everyone to tell everyone.  Get the word out for FREE.   \r<p><p>The Sponsors\r<p><p>Sponsors are companies who wish to be associated with your car show and visitors.  A great car show is an event that sponsors would like to be associated with so keep that in mind when building your sponsor relationships.\r<p><p>The Exhibitors\r<p><p>You will want to round off your show with sponsors, food vendors, swap meet vendors, disc jockey, musicians, bands, bike performances, etc.  Because when it’s all said and done, it’s all about having a good time so give your visitors variety, thrill and excitement.  When they’re happy, they tend to buy from exhibitors.\r<p><p>The Visitors\r<p><p>Vintage and classic car show visitors are unique.   They are in a class by themselves.  They are a special group of people who live the old-school car lifestyle.  They are car collectors, enthusiasts and wannabes – with buying power.  They are a group who recognize and respect universal status symbols and the finer things that money can buy.  That being said, your car show visitors deserve the very best show you can provide.\r<p><p>The Media\r<p><p>Last but not least, you will want to invite the media to make them your partner for all of your car show extravaganzas.  As I’ve stated, you must encourage volunteers to tell everyone but telling the media is your best bet.  A public service announcement will cover a greater audience and territory than you will be able to do by word of mouth.  Another form of ‘media’ is flyers, banners, your web site where people can visit your site for information about upcoming events.  In fact, you should be advertising your car club, group, organization at all times and I.D.IT!PLATES is a great way to drive traffic to your web. \r<p><p>Planning and implementing a car show won’t be easy but if it was it probably wouldn’t be a car show “extravaganza”.  Use this outline to get started with your first car show.  Having a plan will help you to stay focused and efficient – while keeping it simple.  After the show, you will want to see pictures that tell the story about your success.  So ask all volunteers to bring a camera to snap lots of pictures of event activities and car enthusiast having fun.  Please don’t forget to share your pictures with Atlanta Antique Car Club''s photo gallery - for the entire world to see.\r<p>\r<p><p><p><p><p><table width=100% cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 border=0 bgcolor=#dddddd><p><tr><td><p><p><b>About The Author</b><br><p>\r<p><p>Tonza Borden is the developer and administrator of <a href="http://AtlantaAntiqueCarClub.com" target=new>AtlantaAntiqueCarClub.com</a>.

(57, 'The Hydrogen Age Has Begun For BMW', '<b>The Hydrogen Age Has Begun For BMW</b><br><p>&nbsp;by: <b>Jenny McLane</b><p><p>\r<p><p>BMW is presenting the H2R Hydrogen World Speed Record Car. This prototype impressively proved the potential of a hydrogen car with a combustion engine, achieving nine international records in one day. This clearly proves the BMW Group''s long held belief that hydrogen can replace conventional fuel without having to forego the performance and dynamics of a modern premium automobile.\r<p><p>Hydrogen being the lightest element in the universe is also the most common, available in an infinite supply. When mixed with oxygen, hydrogen burns in a virtually clean manner, creating water vapor as exhaust. Thus, BMW believes hydrogen is the fuel of the future.\r<p><p>BMW has seen the promise of hydrogen as a fuel for years. And today, hydrogen-powered, high-performance BMW vehicles are a reality. But building concept cars is just the first step; BMW''s long-term goal is to help create a world of "sustainable mobility." Eventually replacing the cars that run on fossil fuels -- gasoline or diesel oil -- with vehicles that use this clean burning, environmentally friendly element is the carmaker''s vision. \r<p><p>With numerous international partnerships, each dedicated to helping the world build a better future, based on hydrogen energy, BMW is set to achieve its futuristic goal.\r<p><p>Sleek and aerodynamic, the BMW H2R ("Hydrogen Record Car") is one of the first of a new breed of racecars specially developed to run on liquid hydrogen fuel.  With combustion engine that can run on liquid hydrogen or gasoline to propel the vehicle, BMW H2R has already set nine international speed records at the Miramas Proving Grounds in France. \r<p><p>The H2R’s mighty 6.0-liter V-12 engine, which draws on BMW''s advanced Valvetronic and Double-VANOS technology, is based on the 760i’s gasoline-fueled power plant. This H2-powered high performer generates 232 horsepower, helping it to achieve a top speed of over 187 mph. \r<p><p>Refueling a hydrogen-powered vehicle is just as similar to the gasoline powered one. The driver doesn''t even have to get out of the car. A tank card or electronic remote control can easily identify the vehicle, so the fully automated tank-filling robot knows whether to pump liquid or gaseous hydrogen. \r<p><p>Hydrogen gas will not leak into the air when refueling a liquid hydrogen powered BMW. By the time the driver needs more fuel, the hydrogen left in the tank has turned into a gaseous state, at a higher pressure. At the refueling station, -423° F liquid hydrogen is pumped into the tank. As this liquid hydrogen "rains" into the tank, the gaseous hydrogen already there condenses on these super-cold droplets, and the partial pressure in the tank is reduced. As a result, no hydrogen escapes while filling the tank.\r<p><p>At present, there are two hydrogen fueling stations in Germany: one at the Munich airport, and one in Berlin that offers conventional fuels, compressed gaseous hydrogen (CGH2), and liquid hydrogen (LH2). There are also plans underway to build 24 hydrogen-refueling stations throughout California.\r<p><p>Just as BMW strives to create clean fuel and environment friendly cars, Partstrain online store shares the vision by providing high quality, tested BMW parts at very affordable prices.

The Toyota Prius is currentle the cleanest family car on the planet today. Voted as the 2005 European Car of the Year, the Prius sets a new standard on hybrid cars.\r<p><p>The car was chosen as the winner from a list of seven finalists and beat the competition comprehensively. It gathered 406 points as compared to Citroën C4 (267), Ford Focus (228), and Vauxhall Astra (180). Other cars in the consideration were Renault Modus, Peugeot 407 and BMW 1-series.\r<p><p>Toyota Prius Hybrid featured prominently at this year''s "Red Carpet Green Cars" event as twenty of Hollywood''s A-listers are set to arrive at the Oscars in chauffeur-driven Toyota Prius hybrid vehicles instead of the customary gas-guzzling limos. Participants in the "drive" for global sustainability at the "Red Carpet -- Green Cars" event include veterans Susan Sarandon, Tim Robbins, and Robin Williams, as well as some new faces consisting of: Selma Hayek, Penelope Cruz, Layra Linney, and best actor nominee Leonardo DiCaprio among many others.\r<p><p>The latest Consumer Reports owner satisfaction survey reported the Toyota Prius won near-unanimous praise with 94 per cent of respondents saying that they would definitely get one again. The second-generation Toyota Prius becomes the first hybrid to top the list, sending the Lexus LS430 luxury sedan down to second place. The sporty Honda S2000 was in third place.\r<p><p>The owner satisfaction survey is part of the Consumer Reports annual survey, which asked its subscribers if they would buy the car or truck they own again, considering its price, performance, comfort, and reliability. This year CR received more than 250,000 responses to this question for 2002 to 2004 models, which were used to determine owner-satisfaction ratings and lists of Most and Least Satisfying vehicles.\r<p><p>Awareness of the benefits of hybrids has dramatically increased and fuel economy is the No. 1 purchase reason for the Prius, so it''s safe to say that rising fuel prices are putting a spotlight on hybrid vehicles.\r<p><p>Toyota Prius’ use of technology is amazing. Turning a key in a traditional ignition does not do starting the Prius; instead it is initiated by pressing the round “Power” button on the dash. There is an interactive, touch sensitive, Multi-Information display screen mounted in the center console. The display has many modes and can show things like the energy flow between the power train components, fuel consumption, radio settings, climate control, or many of the Prius’ other functions.\r<p><p>Toyota Prius is certainly a hybrid car that is environment friendly. It carries an AT-PZEV rating, which makes the Prius one the cleanest production cars on the road today when it comes to emissions. It is 90% cleaner than that of the average car.

And they’re a hit with customers: The planned yearly output of 3,000 E 320 CDI vehicles for the U.S. was already completely sold out five months after the sales launch, and by the end of the year this figure will have been markedly increased.\r<p><p>Combine legendary Jeep off-road capability with state-of-the-art search and rescue technology; the Jeep Rescue is designed to reach areas in the harshest, most daunting mountainous and desert areas.\r<p><p>“Diesel & the U.S.” is a dream combination for automotive engineers. Many drivers in the U.S. prefer vehicles with high torques and towing capacities — for off road driving, for instance, or for towing heavy loads. And these are exactly the advantages that a diesel engine offers.\r<p><p>Diesel passenger cars don’t even account for a one-percent market share in U.S market unlike in Western Europe, where diesel consumption account for 43 percent of all newly registered passenger cars. Many associate diesel with attributes like “sluggish,” “noisy,” “soot-belching” and “foul-smelling” — a judgment based on experiences with the diesel passenger cars that were still fairly common sights on America’s streets and highways in the 1980s.\r<p><p>The cruising range of the Mercedez Benz E320 CDI and its low fuel consumption is typical of diesel engines: 7.3 liters per 100 kilometers (measured according to the NEDC), which corresponds to a respectable 40 mpg. In comparison, the E 320 equipped with a gasoline engine uses 9.9 liters per 100 kilometers (30 miles per one gallon of gasoline). The high efficiency of the diesel, which has never been matched by other internal combustion engines, simultaneously ensures wide-ranging mobility and savings on the part of consumers.\r<p><p>The same advantages goes to the Jeep Liberty CRD. The four-cylinder 2.8-liter turbo diesel with common-rail direct injection (CRD) has the torque of an eight-cylinder; its 160 hp delivers acceleration like a six-cylinder; but in terms of fuel consumption the engine is very minimal, even by four-cylinder standards. The values are 22 mpg for city driving and 27 mpg on the highway. Compared to the vehicle’s 3.7-liter, six-cylinder gasoline-engine variants with comparable performance, the Liberty CRD’s diesel delivers fuel savings amounting to a hefty 30 percent. Especially this year, when gasoline prices have also increased sharply in the U.S., the two economical diesel variants from DaimlerChrysler are appearing at the ideal time.\r<p><p>The Jeep Liberty CRD and the E 320 CDI operate according to the common-rail principle, which has since been further improved.\r<p><p>Compared to the gasoline engine, the diesel offers several advantages: A diesel engine emits about 20 percent less carbon dioxide (CO2), and its hydrocarbon (HC) emissions are lower than those of comparable gasoline engines. Yet, the fact remains that a diesel still emits more nitrogen oxides (NOx) and soot particles.\r<p><p>Complete with a fold-flat windshield, retractable backlights and four removable doors, the Rescue concept provides a hint at the future of Jeep styling and functionality.

It''s designed as a ready-to-go product with software, maps, and car mount that works straight out of the box (well, almost). Let''s take a look at what it can do.\r<p><p>It does require a little set up. Connect the unit to your PC, load one of the CDs, and choose the region you intend to travel. Now we come to the first handy thing about the TomTom Go. Other brands limit the region choices to only one configuration.\r<p><p>For example, your choice may be Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky. That''s fine if you plan on staying within that region. But what happens when you want to travel to Illinois, too? This can often be a problem because data (map) storage space is limited. It is likely that uploading that additional region requires a larger capacity data storage card which means extra bucks. The TomTom Go allows you many choices of combinations of states so it is very likely that one of the choices easily covers where you are going without extra hassle and expense.\r<p><p>After an easy car installation, it''s time to tell it where to take you. There are three main ways to start navigating. You can enter an address, use the map and point to a place on the touch screen, or select from the thousands of points of interest (POI). Some of the POI categories are: food & drink, shops, parks, airports, and lodging.\r<p><p>Other navigation options allow you to go home, go to a recent destination, or a "favorite." A place you may go to over and over again can be saved as a favorite.\r<p><p>The loud and clear voice directions will say, for instance, "turn left in 200 yards." It will again announce the maneuver closer to the turn. All the time, the TomTom Go is displaying a map of your progress. It has your choice of 3D or 2D views with different displays for day and night use.\r<p><p>TomTom has built in a lot of customizing. There are several choices of voices in different languages and you can program the unit to give you additional voice prompts such as distance since departure or time to instruction. You can make it left--hand friendly or change the map colors. You can even flip the display 180 degrees in case you need to mount it upside--down.\r<p><p>The negatives? This item is not for geeks. In other words, it is limited in its technical aspects -- it was designed for the consumer. For instance, there is no choice for fastest/shortest routing or navigating by longitude/latitude. I also found it lacking a number of points of interest.\r<p><p>Overall, the TomTom Go is a well thought out piece of gear. It''s available online in the range of $550 to $800 US.

However, in the same column you also said that it is sometimes necessary give problem customers the boot.  If the customer is always right, at what point do you think they become so problematic that you should stop doing business with them? -- Gary M.\r<p><p>A:  That column brought a number of emails similar to yours, Gary, requesting that I clarify the line between "the customer is always right" and "sometimes you have to give a customer the boot."   Here''s the bottom line: if you, as a business owner or service provider, are willing to take a customer''s money in exchange for providing him with goods or services, then the customer has what I call "the right of expectation."   This means that the customer has the right to expect you to deliver everything promised in the transaction between you.  For example, if you own a restaurant the customer has the right to expect that their meal will be prepared and served to their satisfaction.  If you are a dry cleaner the customer has the right to expect that you will launder their clothes without returning them in shreds.  If are hired to perform a service the customer has the right to expect that the service will be provided to their satisfaction within the terms of the defined task. \r<p><p>As the business owner, it is your responsibility to meet the customer''s expectations and provide good customer service.  Even if your business does not involve a formal contract that spells out to the letter what should be expected, there is generally a clear understanding of what the customer expects and what you are willing to deliver.  If you back peddle on your end of the bargain, let''s say by serving a bad meal or losing a customer''s laundry and refusing to make things right, then you are guilty of not meeting the expectations of your customer and thereby are guilty of providing bad customer service.\r<p><p>Unfortunately not every entrepreneur puts emphasis on delivering good customer service.  They are in it for the money and damn the customer if they have a problem. Such entrepreneurs were the topic of the column you mentioned, the point of which was, if you make a habit of not meeting your customer''s expectations, you will not be in business for long.\r<p><p>Now let''s look at the flipside.  Just as the customer has the right to expect that he will get his money''s worth when doing business with you, you have the right to expect that your customer will not demand things that are beyond the scope of realistic expectations (or the contract).  If a customer orders hamburger, he shouldn''t expect it to taste like steak unless you have advertised it as such.  If a customer brings you a cotton shirt to launder he should not expect a silk shirt in return.  It''s when the customer''s expectations get out of sync with what should realistically be expected that you will have problems.\r<p><p>We have all had customers who expected far more than was their due: customers who were unreasonable, overly-demanding, condescending, hard to please and sometimes, even dishonest in their dealings with you.  When a customer''s reasonable expectations become unreasonable demands you must decide whether or not that customer is doing more harm to your business than good.\r<p><p>So here is the line in the sand between the "customer is always right" and "sometimes you have to give the customer the boot" -  if a customer crosses the line from being an asset to being a detriment to your business, you should consider giving that customer the boot.\r<p><p>This is easier said than done if that customer constitutes a large chunk of your revenue, but even then you have to consider what your business might be like if that problem customer was not in the picture.  Would the time you spend dealing with the problem customer be better spent on sales calls that might expand your client base and grow your business (a business that is dependent on one client is a house of cards)?  Would your employees be happier not having to deal with this customer?  Would you sleep better nights knowing that you don''t have a dozen phone messages from him on your desk every morning?\r<p><p>The easiest way to decide how much trouble a customer is worth is to look at the amount of revenue this customer brings in versus the time and expense of meeting his expectations.  If this customer pays you $1,000 a month, but costs you $2,000 in time spent keeping them happy, this customer is actually costing you money.   Just a handful of these kinds of customers will put you out of business fast..\r<p><p>For example, I once had a client whose business was worth several thousand dollars a year to my software company''s bottom line.  However, this client proved to be problematic from the second the contract was signed.  He and his employees called our office ten times a day and dominated my tech support team''s time with IT problems that were not even related to the service we were contracted to provide.  It got so bad that my employees cringed every time the phone rang because they were afraid it was this client calling again.\r<p><p>When the time came to renew this client''s contract it wasn''t hard for me to decide to give him the boot.  I simply did the math.  This client had added thousands of dollars to my company''s bottom line, but had cost me at least that much in handholding and support, not to mention the mental anguish he had caused my employees.  I opted not to renew the contract and politely invited the client to take his business elsewhere.\r<p><p>The perfect customer relationship is win/win, meaning that your customer benefits from your product or service and your company prospers by delivering the product or service.  The relationship must be built on mutual respect and honest intention.  It is when the relationship becomes win/lose that you must be ready to take action.  If the customer thinks he can hold you over a barrel and get more out of you than he has paid for, the relationship and your business suffer for it.\r<p><p>Look, you don''t need me to hit you in the head with a stupid stick on this one.  You know who your problem customers are and you know that you will eventually have to deal with them.  You have to consider the value of every customer in the long run, not just their value today.  \r<p><p>Is the customer making demands that are beyond the scope of what should be reasonably expected?    If the customer constantly demands more than they are entitled to and gets angry when you refuse to comply, consider giving them the boot.\r<p><p>Is the customer taking advantage of your good graces?  Some customers may mistake your willingness to please for weakness and try to wring more out of your relationship than they should.  If the customer has a record of trying to take advantage of you and plays every angle to get more from you than they deserve, consider giving them the boot.\r<p><p>Is this customer a threat to your reputation?  Let''s face it; there is nothing more harmful to your reputation than a dissatisfied customer with a big mouth.  And it does not matter who is at fault in the disagreement, a disgruntled customer is going to bad mouth you in the end - especially if they were at fault.  If you suspect a customer might be the sort to one day air dirty laundry in public, consider giving them the boot.\r<p><p>Does the customer pay in a timely manner? If you have a customer that is consistently 90 to 120 days late in paying even when your contract clearly outlines your payment terms to be otherwise, it may be indicative of other problems to come.  If you feel the client is a payment risk, consider giving them the boot.\r<p><p>What''s the best way to avoid a customer booting?  The best answer is to have a contract that clearly spells out the specifics of the relationship.  The contracts I use in my various businesses clearly define the services to be provided, the cost of those services, and the timeline and terms under which those services will be rendered.  If there is a deviation from the contract, we write an addendum that details any changes and their effect on the contract.  Do I still have to give some customers the boot?  You bet, but not very often.  It''s hard for a customer to cry foul when everything is there in black and white right above his signature.\r<p><p>What if your business doesn''t use contracts?  Then hang a poster in your shop or have a hand-out that clearly defines what your customer can expect from your business and then deliver what you promise.  If you have a poster or hand-out that clearly outlines your services, your rates, scheduling, return policy, etc., there should be very little that the customer can complain about.  \r<p><p>I know, famous last words.\r<p><p>Here''s to your success!\r<p><p><p><p><p><table width=100% cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 border=0 bgcolor=#dddddd><p><tr><td><p><p><b>About The Author</b><br><p>\r<p><p>Small Business Q&A is written by veteran entrepreneur and syndicated columnist, Tim Knox.

It has set a new world altitude record for a motor vehicle of 6,080 metres. Accomplished by a standard-engined Touareg 3.2 litre V8, this record has been officially recognized by the Guinness World Records™ Book. \r<p><p>This feat was achieved on January 29 in the slopes of the world''s highest volcano. The expedition team battled against icy winds and lack of oxygen to achieve this record. The altimeter and GPS system displayed the result of 6,080 metres. Currently, this is the highest point on the earth''s surface that a vehicle can reach and safely return from. By reaching this altitude, the Touareg proves its abilities in extreme conditions and surpassed the performance of all other off-road vehicles. \r<p><p>Headed by Rainer Zietlow, the team of eight first went through the Atacama Desert, the world''s driest area. The base camp is located above the salt lake Laguna Santa Rosa, famous for its pink flamingoes, 4,400 metres above sea level. From here the trail continues over stones and pebbles with an 80 per cent gradient, snow fields and soft volcanic sand. Driving the Touareg was Ronald Bormann, previous winner of the European Truck Trail competition.  \r<p><p>In some sections of the mountainous terrain, huge rocks blocked the path. A winch, fitted as standard accessory to the Touareg Expedition, a special edition version, helped the team on its way. There were also spotlights fitted to the roof rack, which also accommodates spare wheels and rescue equipment. Because at 5,000 metres the air becomes thinner, the crew was given additional oxygen by altitude specialist Dr. Rainald Fischer, to prevent potentially life-threatening altitude sickness. \r<p><p>The route of the expedition was selected with the help of the Institute of Cartography at the University of Dresden following a four-week survey of the summit region for the purpose of making new maps. In return, the knowledge gained in the expedition will help the cartographers verify their work. \r<p><p>The Institute for Cartography at the University of Dresden helped to select the route to the summit following a recent four-week survey of the summit region for the purpose of making new maps. The knowledge gained by the expedition will help the cartographers verify their work. But the most important scientific aspect of the expedition was the installation of a seismographic station, managed by the Geological Research Centre in Potsdam in this region endangered by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. \r<p><p>With this achievement, the Volkswagen Touareg establishes its reputation as a tough off-roader capable of meeting challenges such as extreme weather conditions and rocky terrain. Volkswagen''s renowned excellence in automotive design is manifested in the Touareg, along with other models including the Golf, Jetta, and the new Beetle. \r<p><p>Meanwhile, whether on such extreme conditions or on sleepy town roads, any Volkswagen deserve excellent maintenance for it to offer the best functionality and longevity.

(68, 'DaimlerChrysler Unveils New Fuel Cell Vehicle in Geneva', '<b>DaimlerChrysler Unveils New Fuel Cell Vehicle in Geneva</b><br><p>&nbsp;by: <b>Jenny McLane</b><p><p>\r<p><p>The next generation of fuel cell technology was unveiled at the 2005 Geneva Motor Show by DaimlerChrysler, the pioneer of fuel cell drive. Sports tourers are now the new members of the family of fuel cell vehicles with the Mercedes Benz B-Class sporting the enw F-Cell. This F-Cell''s unique sandwich concept developed by Mercedes Benz is perfect for this type of drive unit.\r<p><p>The fuel cell''s emission free operation is congruous with sporty, dynamic driving. the technical data proves this fact: the high-torque electric motor will develop more than 100 kW -- 35 kW more power than its predecessor generation. And because the fuel cell reduces fuel consumption and further enhances storage capacity, the operating range has now been increased to almost 250 miles (400 km). Also, component reliability and longevity has been enhanced. \r<p><p>"With this car, we are continuing our highly successful practical tests on an even larger scale," said Dr. Thomas Weber, member of DaimlerChrysler''s Board of Management with responsibility for Research and Technology and for the development of the Mercedes Car Group. \r<p><p>Since 1990, DaimlerChrysler engineers and researchers have been working on the automotive application of the fuel cell technology. The first fuel cell vehicle, the NECAR 1 was introduced in 1994. More than 20 other research vehicles and prototypes have since been presented. The performance and reliability have been steadily enhanced while the size and weight of the drive system have been reduced. This new Mercedes-Benz B-Class F-Cell is another significant milestone along the road to market maturity for the fuel cell.\r<p><p>In 2003, DaimlerChrysler launched the world''s most extensive series practical tests for the fuel cell in cars, vans and regular service buses. There are now more than a hundred fuel cell vehicles that are currently in everyday application. These fuel-cell vehicles provide DaimlerChrysler engineers with vital information for the development of this future oriented technology. This encompasses optimization of the vehicles and their components, the establishment of an infrastructure, and the increased acceptance of hydrogen technology among drivers and passengers. \r<p><p>Elsewhere in the world, fuel cell technology continues to flourish. Since 2003, there have been 30 Mercedes-Benz Citaro buses with fuel cell drive that are now on regular route service in ten major European cities. Three buses are now in operation in Perth, Australia and in Beijing, China. These vehicles must prove their worth in the most varied of climactic conditions. On average, these buses have now covered more than 300,000 miles (500,000 km) and transported more than two million passengers, who have been convinced by the advantages of this quiet, emission-free technology. There are also several fuel cell-powered Sprinter vans that are currently used in delivery operations in Germany and the United States. \r<p><p>Since late 2004, 60 Mercedes-Benz F-Cell''s have been operating in the United States, Germany, Japan, and Singapore. Approximately 190,000 miles (300,000 km) have now been covered in this first test phase under highly diverse conditions and documented with these vehicles. In the long term, the fuel cell provides the best opportunities for securing uncompromisingly environment-friendly mobility for the automobile: the fuel cell runs on either pure hydrogen or hydrogen media, and is thus a genuine zero-emission power unit: electrical energy is released in a chemical reaction between the hydrogen and atmospheric oxygen to drive an electric motor.\r<p><p>Moreover, the fuel cell has an efficiency factor approximately twice that of the internal combustion engine. In order to focus expertise and resources, and to press ahead with the development of the fuel cell, DaimlerChrysler has entered into a strategic alliance with Ford Motor Company and the fuel cell specialist Ballard Power Systems.  Partnerships are an important part of fuel cell technology development.  \r<p><p>The fuel cell is the key technology for emission-free driving of the future and is the long-term objective of DaimlerChrysler''s five-stage Energy for the Future roadmap.  DaimlerChrysler is continuing to optimize the internal combustion engine, since the potential of gasoline and diesel engines has by no means been exhausted.  The aim is to reduce fuel consumption and exhaust emissions, while at the same time enhancing driving pleasure, power development and comfort.  DaimlerChrysler is also committed to optimizing fuel quality worldwide and is supporting the fuel evolution from crude oil to largely CO2-neutral fuels derived from biomass.  Hybrid drive is a significant interim solution along the road to emission-free mobility with the fuel cell.\r<p><p>As the pioneer in fuel cell technology, Chrysler continues to innovate and create better and more future-oriented automobiles that are proof of the company''s stamp of excellence in the automotive industry. Fuel cell technology will definitely enhance the entire driving experience and will improve the operation and maintenance of these vehicles. Meanwhile, one of the best ways to maintain the quality of a vehicle is by replacing worn out and outdated parts with new ones.  By doing this, a Chrysler auto acquires a new life with excellent quality parts.  \r<p><p>These parts are available in many online stores that make shopping easier and faster.

The fresh smell of leather as you ease yourself into the plush leather seats. The whole car is gleaming. As you drive it out your driveway, you steal a glance at the reflection of your beautiful ride. \r<p><p>Fast forward 12 months. How does your "new" car look now? If you take a picture of your car now and compare it to when you first bought it, would you notice any difference? How is it that some cars continue to look "brand new" even though they are already 3 years old while others just look tired, dull and "old" just 12 months out of the showroom? \r<p><p>It is possible to keep your car gleaming new. You just need to know how to care for it. \r<p><p>1) Wash Your Car Weekly \r<p><p>Dust and dirt will accumulate as your drive your car. Even if you just leave it in your garage, the paintwork will accumulate dust. It is especially important to wash your car if your car was exposed to rain. The water droplets that accumulate on your paintwork will leave tough watermark stains if you let them dry under the sun. The sun "bakes" in the watermark stains and you’ll find it especially tough to remove them later on. Your best bet is to give your car a quick wash and wipe dry if you’ve driven in the rain. \r<p><p>When washing your car, use a quality car shampoo like Meguiar’s NXT Generation Car Wash (<a href="http://www.fdcars.com/newsletter/n2-2.htm" target=new>http://www.fdcars.com/newsletter/n2-2.htm</a>). You’ll find it much easier to wash and dry your car if you use a soft terry cloth or a cloth diaper. I always keep a dozen cloth diapers ready in my house even though I don’t have kids :) . They’re cheap, absorbent and soft so that it does not scratch your paintwork. If you want to be flashy, you can get something like the Ultimate Wipe cloth, once again from Meguiar’s (<a href="http://www.fdcars.com/newsletter/n2-1.htm" target=new>http://www.fdcars.com/newsletter/n2-1.htm</a>). \r<p><p>Hose your car down to remove any excess dirt and grime. Then use your cloth to apply the car shampoo. Once you’ve covered the whole car, hose off the shampoo, using a clean cloth to wipe away any remaining shampoo residue. It is critical that you wipe your car dry. If you leave the car to dry naturally, all your hard work thus far will go to waste. \r<p><p>Make sure you clean your rims. Brake dust will accumulate there, making your car look dirty even if the paintwork is spotless. You will also want to vacuum the interior of your car every few weeks to keep it clean. \r<p><p>2) Wax Your Car Once a Month \r<p><p>To keep your paintwork gleaming, you need to wax it. Of course, you could send it to an auto detailer for this. However, if you have an hour to spare during your weekend, it is really not that difficult to wax your car. \r<p><p>Before waxing, make sure you wash and wipe dry your car. Park your car in a cool and shady spot. It is best not to wax your car directly under the sun. Use a good car wax like Meguiar’s NXT Generation Tech Wax (<a href="http://www.fdcars.com/newsletter/n2-3.htm" target=new>http://www.fdcars.com/newsletter/n2-3.htm</a>). Apply the wax in a circular motion using the included sponge. Work on your car section by section. Remember which section you worked on first. Once you’ve finished applying the entire car, it’s time to remove the excess wax. \r<p><p>Use a soft terry cloth or cloth diaper to wipe of the excess wax. Start by wiping the panel that you first applied the wax and work on from there. It is best to use different sides of the cloth as wipe off the wax since it will accumulate on your cloth. You can either use a new piece of cloth as each is clogged with wax or alternatively shake off the wax from your cloth. \r<p><p>Lean close to your car and check whether there is any residue left. Clean any remaining residue. \r<p><p>Wash your cleaning cloth with a liquid softener (just like you wash your clothes). This will make sure there isn’t any dirt or grime stuck to the cloth for your next waxing session. \r<p><p>3) Apply Tyre Wax For That Slick Black Look \r<p><p>To complete the wet & shiny look, apply tyre wax after every wash/wax. Look for ones that come with a trigger spray so that you can apply it easily. Something like Meguiar’s Hot Shine High Gloss Tyre Spray (<a href="http://www.fdcars.com/newsletter/n2-4.htm" target=new>http://www.fdcars.com/newsletter/n2-4.htm</a>) would work beautifully. This takes less than 3 minutes to do but it makes a big difference. \r<p><p>4) Keep That New Leather Smell \r<p><p>If your car has leather seats, it is important to clean and condition it at least once every 2 months. Use a leather cleaner/conditioner like Meguiar’s Medallion Premium Leather Care (<a href="http://www.fdcars.com/newsletter/n2-5.htm" target=new>http://www.fdcars.com/newsletter/n2-5.htm</a>). Apply using a clean terry cloth or cloth diaper. Wipe off any excess conditioner with a clean cloth. Doing this once every month of two keeps your leather supple and smelling like new. \r<p><p>While cleaning and conditioning your leather, you will want to work on the vinyl surfaces of your car as well. Your dashboard, door inserts and central console is normally made of vinyl. So, use something like Meguiar’s Vinyl & Leather Cleaner/Conditioner (<a href="http://www.fdcars.com/newsletter/n2-6.htm" target=new>http://www.fdcars.com/newsletter/n2-6.htm</a>) for this. This works much like the leather cleaner but is specially suited for vinyl surfaces. \r<p><p>5) Stand Back & Admire Your "Brand New" Car \r<p><p>Follow the routine above and you guarantee yourself a car that looks, feels and smells like new even 3 years down the road. Your friends and family will be impressed. When it’s time to sell your car, you’ll likely fetch much higher prices. First impressions count when selling your car. And a car with gleaming new paintwork and a spotless interior makes a VERY strong first impression! \r<p><p>P.S.

(71, 'Pilot Ground Training', '<b>Pilot Ground Training</b><br><p>&nbsp;by: <b>Stuart Simpson</b><p><p>\r<p><p>All flight training begins on the ground.  The worst place to learn a new skill is in an airplane.  It can be very difficult to grasp new concepts in the air without reviewing them first on the ground.  In the plane, training in the cockpit can have other environmental issues such as cold (or hot), noisy, and bumpy.\r<p><p>You want to get up in the air as soon as possible and as frequently as possible.  Don’t waste time at the airport studying things you could have done at home.  Get your studying done before you get to the air.  Some of the pilot instructors may have been guilty of skipping some of the ground training so they could get in the air quick, too.  \r<p><p>I’ve heard that some pilots have even missed flying lessons because they didn’t do their learning on the ground and weren’t ready to go up.  They had to spend their training in the classroom.  What a waste of expensive instructor time.\r<p><p>Flight training by referring to the instruments only is hard to learn, but can be practiced on the ground.  You have to do this to become a private pilot and if you want an instrument rating.\r<p><p>Don’t think of ground training is a waste of your money.  Don’t have a bad attitude and hopefully your training pilot won’t have one either.  Also, poor preparation can hinder you.  Ground time can be expensive and some charge the same rate for ground time as they do flight time, but remember, the CFI has to make a living, too.  Try to include a mix of ground time and flight time.  \r<p><p>Be sure you know what is going to be covered before any lesson and find out what is expected from you.  If you show up unprepared for a lesson, then expect to spend more time on the ground.  You sure don’t want to have your flight time shortened or even canceled.\r<p><p>Remember, preparation is the key to more flight time.  Your flight instructor’s mail goal in your pilot training is to keep you safe.  Proper ground instruction makes flying easier and more enjoyable. \r<p><p><p><p><p><table width=100% cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 border=0 bgcolor=#dddddd><p><tr><td><p><p><b>About The Author</b><br><p>\r<p><p>Stuart Simpson\r<p><br><a href="http://www.pilot-training-review.com/" target=new>http://www.pilot-training-review.com/</a>\r<p>\r<p>\r<p>\r<p><p></td></tr><p></table>', 'articles/art75.html'),

The all-new 2005 Xterra offers improvements on virtually all functional and user attributes with more power, more roominess and more features, including enhanced off-road performance systems.\r<p><p>The 2005 Xterra will be offered in three trim levels – S, Off-Road and SE.  Each model comes with a standard 4.0-liter 265-horsepower V6 and is offered in both 2WD and 4WD.  Starting Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the Xterra S 2WD M/T is $20,800.  The Xterra Off-Road model with 4WD M/T features a MSRP of 25,500, while the SE 2WD A/T features a MSRP of $25,300.\r<p><p>Complete pricing and option packages are available on the attached sheets.\r<p><p>The 2005 Nissan Xterra continues the theme of the original – everything you need, nothing you don’t.  But now truer than ever,   The enhancements for the second generation Xterra, all in keeping with the spirit of the first, include a redesigned interior and exterior, new engine and platform. \r<p><p>The new Xterra utilizes a modified version of the F-Alpha platform, developed for the full-size Nissan Armada and full-size Nissan Titan pickup, tailored to suit this application.  For its use in Xterra, the platform utilizes an independent double-wishbone front and solid axle leaf spring rear suspension, standard 4.0-liter DOHC V6 rated at 265 horsepower and 284 lb-ft of torque, and a choice of 5-speed automatic or 6-speed manual transmissions. \r<p><p>The 2005 Xterra is offered with an available enhanced off-road system.  The part-time 4WD system includes 2WD/4HI/4LO modes and electronically controlled transfer case.  A Vehicle Dynamic Control (VDC) system is also available, along with other advanced off-road capabilities.\r<p><p>Xterra’s new exterior styling evokes that of the original, including a highly functional roof rack (now with covered gear box).  Inside, the 2005 Xterra offers more room, especially in 2nd row head room and leg room, and enhanced utility of the multi-flex cargo area – including an Easy Clean Cargo Area and a Utili-Track channel system in the cargo floor.\r<p><p>“When Xterra debuted in 1999, it truly set the mark in terms of its combination of outstanding purposeful unique styling matched with practical size and functionality,” said Mark McNabb, vice president and general manager, Nissan Division.  “The all-new Xterra follows this path with an even more capable, more powerful and truly authentic SUV built specifically for the needs of the core outdoor enthusiast.”\r<p><p>In North America, Nissan''s operations include automotive styling, engineering, consumer and corporate financing, sales and marketing, distribution and manufacturing.

At company press events in London and Chicago, the new Dodge Caliber and Dodge Nitro were unveiled to convey the brand''s potential future direction. \r<p><p>“Today is a great day for Dodge,” said Dieter Zetsche, Chrysler Group President and CEO. “These two new concepts suggest the global potential of the brand as it prepares to expand into world markets. While different in product expression, both Caliber and Nitro embody the bold, powerful and capable values of Dodge. Our international positioning for the brand and its future model lineup will be entirely consistent with these established core values.”\r<p><p>The Dodge Caliber Concept Car\r<p><p>Exhibited to a select group in London for the first time, the new Dodge Caliber Concept is a five-door vehicle that combines a sporty coupe-like profile with the strength, stance and functionality. The sheer surface styling commands attention and evokes the Dodge brand attributes. The Dodge Caliber concept will be revealed to the public at the 75th Salon de l’Automobile in Geneva, Switzerland.\r<p><p>Simultaneously in the USA, the mid-size Dodge Nitro SUV concept was revealed at the Chicago Auto Show, providing even further proof of the brand’s future potential. With a bold and powerful design statement, the five-passenger Nitro would be the first mid-size SUV for Dodge, designed to attract customers seeking style, performance and utility.\r<p><p>The Dodge Nitro Concept Car\r<p><p>“We have a clear brand identity for Dodge. The brand is all about attitude — it’s bold, confident and assertive,” said Joe Eberhardt, Executive Vice President — Global Sales, Marketing and Service. “And we have established a strong and distinct identity for our new Dodge products. That’s what allowed us to tease international markets with the introduction of the Dodge Viper SRT10 roadster last year and hint at where we can go in the years to come.”\r<p><p>Speaking in London, Eberhardt said consumer research among 20,000 participants in Germany, France, Italy and the UK identified a segment of potential buyers that align themselves with the core values of Dodge. He said that research also showed that there is not a single brand that leads this segment, creating opportunity for the Dodge brand to grow the Chrysler Group business internationally, while maintaining its unique brand identity.\r<p><p>Chrysler Group has said that, between 2003 and 2007, with the expansion of the Dodge brand, the company will more than double the number of Chrysler Group models available outside of North America. The number of right-hand drive and diesel-equipped models also will more than double during this same time period.\r<p><p>Beginning in 2006, Eberhardt said the Dodge product portfolio for markets outside of North America will consist mainly of C- and D-segment vehicles, both left- and right-hand drive, offering powerful yet fuel-efficient petrol engines and state-of-the-art diesel engines.\r<p><p>When maintaining a Dodge Vehicle like these new models, it is important to get the best possible parts to get the best results. A Dodge owner must be as discriminating as possible when choosing replacement parts for his car. A good choice of parts supplier is therefore very significant. Pick a part store that has a good reputation. Go online and browse through the many online stores offering excellent parts. One of the best online parts suppliers is Auto Parts Train.

(75, 'The Popularity of the NHRA', '<b>The Popularity of the NHRA</b><br><p>&nbsp;by: <b>Richard A. Brink</b><p><p>\r<p><p>It is the Christmas holiday weekend, the family is sitting around the livingroom discussing how much of a very fine meal we''ve eaten, when the conversation shifts: "You on for the drag races this summer?" I asked my brother. "Oh yeah," he answers back. As we reminisce about the past years NHRA Nationals and discuss plans and dates for this years race, we wonder why the NHRA does not have a bigger following. If you like fast cars, and you have not been to a NHRA Nationals event, you have no idea what your missing. That, we decided, is exactly the problem. You have got to see it live to understand why it has the following it does. Television is at fault, after-all this sport has many times the horsepower of NASCAR, the pitts are open to anyone with a ticket, and the drivers come out of the haulers just to sign autographs on a regular basis. They even give you a free, glossy team photo to get the autograph signed on. The problem is none of that comes across on TV. When you watch NASCAR they televise the pre-race activities, the on-track activities, and the post-race activities. They even have a segment called CRANK IT UP, in which the anouncers dont say a word for a few laps so you can litterally blow your speakers apart with your surround sound. This helps give you the feeling you are at the track. You could be watching your first NASCAR event and by the end of the race come away with the feeling you understand it, and more importatly you will feel like you know the drivers. I dont want to take anything away from NASCAR; it is a great motorsport and they have done a fine job of marketing to get to this point. But (and it is a big but) there is no feeling in the world like two top fuel dragsters coming off the line simultaneously; it will shake your soul. Trying to explain this feeling to someone who has never experienced it is futile. Nor can you explain the smells of the track, the smoking tires, the rubber dust in the air, or the way your eyes burn from the half-burnt alcohol sprayed from the firey pipes. The sound...absolutely deafening. \r<p><p>If we could somehow get these sights and sounds through our TV''s, the NHRA would explode with popularity. "Maybe they should send out bag of rubber dust and a candle that smells like burnt rubber before each broadcast," we quipped. \r<p><p>In reality, the biggest thing I see that can be done is for television to help us get to know the drivers and their crews. Even the World Poker Tour understands they can''t just show you people playing cards. We have to feel as if these drivers are our friends. Introduce us to their world! We must be able to connect with them on a personal level. Show us what it takes to go 300mph in less than five seconds! The crews can tear down an engine and put it back together in less than an hour. Show us that! Dont talk while the rockets thunder down the track. Let us blow our speakers! It will never take the place of being at the track, but it would go a long way in bringing the NHRA back to the fore-front of the racing world. \r<p><p>Do yourself a favor, the next time the NHRA is in your neighborhood, GO. Take your kids, call some friends, or go by yourself; just go. There is no experience like it in the world, at least not yet. Maybe someday soon, when we can board a rocket bound for the moon, the NHRA might have competition. Until that day comes you owe it to yourself to take in an event.\r<p><p>Richard A.

(76, 'Buying A Pre-Owned Automobile', '<b>Buying A Pre-Owned Automobile</b><br><p>&nbsp;by: <b>Michael J Medeiros</b><p><p>\r<p><p>Purchasing a Pre-owned Automobile can be nerve racking for consumers. There are a number of concerns toward the integrity of the Automobile. In addition, it is difficult to compare the appearance and condition of a used car to the asking price. With some simple steps, a consumer can make a pre-owned purchase simple and know they are obtaining the vehicle for a reasonable price.\r<p><p>Understand the Sellers Mindset – Why is the Car for Sale?\r<p><p>Probably the most important factor to consider is the reason a vehicle is for sale. Factors of the owners life may have lead him or her to require a new vehicle. For example, their children may become involved in sports or a new child may have been introduced to the family. Reasons like this are good to hear. They indicate that the seller probably would have kept the car and was satisfied with the reliability and comforts offered. \r<p><p>In contrast, if the seller simply became sickened by the vehicle and upgraded, take a look at what they are driving now. Did they upgrade to a newer model of the same vehicle? If so, it is evident that they where pleased with the vehicle that was for sale. Otherwise, the vehicle may become a headache. If the seller purchased a different make and model, ask about the newer car. Their response will indicate what was important to them at the time they purchased the vehicle. These elements of importance are good indicators of things they disliked in the vehicle for sale. Therefore, if a hint of reliability is muttered, the vehicle for sale could be a, “lemon”.\r<p><p>What has been done to the Vehicle for sale?\r<p><p>Ask for receipts in advance. To learn what was done to a vehicle, receipts are fairly important and provide good proof along with the date service occurred. Ask for receipts in advance. The seller may have to dig through documents to find receipts for service and parts. Because of this, asking when viewing a vehicle may not be a wise choice. In contrast, if the seller knows in advance, he or she will have time to find all the related receipts.\r<p><p>Analyze the modifications that had been done. Did the owner install components that increase the fuel mileage? The vehicle may have been a financial burden. Did the owner install performance enhancing parts? The vehicle may have lacked power or did not perform satisfactorily. Did the owner install factory parts? This is a good indicator that the owner was satisfied with the vehicle and the parts proved reliable to him or her.\r<p><p>Modifications to a vehicle will usually prove to be unsatisfactory. Keep in mind, before a vehicle is manufactured, auto makers spend thousands of dollars in engineering the vehicle. They are primarily concerned with ergonomics, performance, and safety. These engineers found the stock tire created the perfect wheel for the vehicle, the exhaust system proved safe and provided the best engine performance, and the external engine components offered economical benefits without robbing motor performance. In most cases, modified parts are throwing away all the money spent on research and engineering in a vehicle. Unless there is a purpose other than what the vehicle was designed, racing or carrying heavy loads, it is a wise choice to look for stock parts.\r<p><p>What is the appearance of the Vehicle?\r<p><p>One of the best ways to judge a vehicle is by the appearance. A clean and neat interior is a good sign that person was happy with a vehicle. In contrast, a poorly maintained interior may indicate that the vehicle was neglected. Did the owner ensure the carpet was preserved by using mats? Are there any burn wholes in the upholstery? Did they clean spills in the vehicle or let them become stains in the carpeting? Neglect on the inside is commonly believed to provide good insight on a poorly maintained vehicle.\r<p><p>Walking around the outside vehicle can reveal the driving behavior of the current owner. Look at the drive wheels, are they worn significantly more than the other tires on the vehicle? This would indicate heavy acceleration, which is extremely abusive to internal engine parts and the drive train of the vehicle. Look for variations in the vehicles paint. If variations are seen, the vehicle could have been in an accident. Another indication of bodywork is to look for over-spray within the engine compartment and door jams. While a history report is fairly resourceful, accidents could have occurred that are not listed on the report. An inspection is always recommended. After a high speed accident, vehicles tend to have significant problems.\r<p><p>What is the Vehicle Worth?\r<p><p>Being value conscious is wise as a consumer. There are a number of resources that indicate a car value. In most cases, the seller of a pre-owned vehicle was offered a very low price as a trade-in value for their new vehicle. They are probably willing to sell the vehicle for less than, “book value,” as they are wisely attempting to gain more than what was offered at the dealer. However, book value can lack many considerations and used only as a reference point. The best way to judge the value is to shop. Look at similar models for sale and evaluate the condition and desired preferences.\r<p><p>Conduct research and read reviews of the vehicle. The vehicle may appear to be in mint condition, yet the owner neglected to bring the vehicle to a dealer for an important recall. Most would agree, this would greatly affect the overall condition as the vehicle may not be in safe working order. In addition, there are a variety of options available for each vehicle. Which options add value that can be confirmed on the vehicle for sale? Does the vehicle actually have the premium sound system and manufactures premium wheels? Put more effort into assessing the value then mileage and model, to ensure the vehicle is worth the asking price or making an offer.\r<p><p>Purchase a pre-owned vehicle with confidence\r<p><p>Through researching a desired vehicle and shopping around, a consumer can purchase a reliable vehicle and save thousands of dollars for their efforts. The savings in purchasing a pre-owned vehicle could be considered as a payment for the work done. In addition to savings, purchasing a well maintained pre-owned vehicle eliminates the fear of purchasing a poorly designed vehicle. There have been thousands of people whom purchased and tested the vehicle. The vehicle has something better than a crash test. It was tested in the real world.\r<p><p><p><p><p><table width=100% cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 border=0 bgcolor=#dddddd><p><tr><td><p><p><b>About The Author</b><br><p>\r<p><p>Michael J Medeiros is an entrepreneur residing in New Jersey.

No problemo, we''ll have you up and running in no time! \r<p><p>Just in case you''re wondering about how to install other neon or led lights sold at "out-lets" other then the All-Neon-Car-Lights.com website, I can assure you that  most of the instructions that come with each of the various kits are easy to follow. They have been designed with the do-it-yourselfer in mind. (Or at least they "should" be). However, if you are in need of any special advise about a particular car lighting product, please contact us via the email link provided below and we will do our best to help you. \r<p><p>For some people, a car is a means of transport and nothing more. As long as their vehicle gets them from point A to point B and back again, has nice comfortable seats, a good sound system and a coffee mug holder, it serves all of its purposes well. And of course there are other drivers for which a car is much, much more -- It can be an extension of their personality or an object of their fixation. In this huge world of automotive accessories, there is no product that screams louder than the underbody light kit for this type of individual. If you consider cruising in your car is among your favorite hobbies and you relish the stares of pedestrians and fellow-motorists, then a under car light kit may be for you. \r<p><p>These lights, which mount to the body around the perimeter of the vehicle''s undercarriage, come in kits that contain the elements you''ll need for installation. The "how to install under car lights" instructions that you''ll be directed to shortly, are fairly straight forward, but since it requires drilling into the body of the vehicle and substantial electrical work (depending on the kit you buy), it''s best left to the more experienced do-it-yourselfers. If this project seems a little too hard for you, rest assured that there is a growing number of custom shops that perform this type of installation. If you do decide to take on the installation yourself, which anyone can do with the correct instructions, be sure to purchase a kit that is compatible with your vehicle, and read and follow the instructions that come with the kit carefully. \r<p><p>Ever wondered how long car lighting kits have been around? Well Hot Rods were the first cars to have undercar lighting installed on them, (although, the lights were nothing like they are today) back before import and export was a big industry world wide. And today, thanks to the World Wide Web and the fact that import and export is now more commonly practiced throughout the world, they have become more popular then ever before.\r<p><p>So this is the reason why we set out to write up these "How to install under car lights" instructions, as they are *required* by people like yourself.\r<p><p>Our team of dedicated Market & Product Researchers and including myself, have spent an enormous amount of time & money installing under car kits from a variety of manufacturers, and as a result after all this testing, we can now provide you with generic instructions on how to install under car lights on your vehicle. We also found after this extensive testing was carried out, that Plasmaglow had the best, "all round" car lighting products available on the market today, outlasting and out-performing the competition in every aspect, hence the reason why we recommend their products on the all-neon-car-lights.com website. \r<p><p>As a related note, please keep in mind that the main issues we face with having neon or LED car lights on our vehicles these days is the fact that they are often frowned upon by the authorities. So to avoid any uninvited fines, its best to install neon lights under a car so as they can be activated through a separate switch rather than having them come on when the headlights are turned on. To do this, you can run a power wire directly from the car battery to the kits operating switch, thus by-passing the vehicles headlight wires. \r<p><p>The "How to install under car lights" instructions below have been designed & written with ALL "under car kits" in mind. These instructions will benefit those who have LED under car kits to install, and/or Neon under car kits. \r<p><p>Enjoy your new undercar lights, and drive safely.\r<p><p>Kind regards\r<p><p>Antonio Gabellone\r<p><p>Please choose the instructions below that suit your needs:\r<p><p>For LED under car lights installation instructions - visit:\r<p><br><a href="http://www.all-neon-car-lights.com/how-to-install-led-under-car-lights.html" target=new>www.all-neon-car-lights.com/how-to-install-led-under-car-lights.html</a>\r<p>\r<p><p>For Neon under car lights installation instructions - visit:\r<p><br><a href="http://www.all-neon-car-lights.com/how-to-install-neon-under-car-lights.html" target=new>www.all-neon-car-lights.com/how-to-install-neon-under-car-lights.html</a>\r<p><p><p><p><p><table width=100% cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 border=0 bgcolor=#dddddd><p><tr><td><p><p><b>About The Author</b><br><p>\r<p><p>Copyright <a href="http://All-Neon-Car-Lights.com" target=new>All-Neon-Car-Lights.com</a> 2005. \r<p><p>Permission is granted to reprint this article provided you supply a live link to the authors website at; <a href="http://www.all-neon-car-lights.com" target=new>http://www.all-neon-car-lights.com</a>\r<p><p><a href="mailto:Antonio@all-neon-car-lights.com">Antonio@all-neon-car-lights.com</a>\r<p>\r<p>\r<p>\r<p><p></td></tr><p></table>', 'articles/art81.html'),

The new Michelin Tweel is just such a product. Mounted on an Audi A4, demonstating its flexibility, is what Michelin North America Inc. has dubbed the Tweel. It is a tire and wheel combo that comes as an assembly, requires no air(the flexibilty comes from the spokes)and is retreadable. Can you imagine never having a flat again? \r<p><p>The Tweel uses a network of elastomeric polyurethane spokes to control the ride characteristics. These ride characteristics can be set independently of each other, for instance, verticle stiffness-which primarily affects ride comfort-and lateral stiffness-which affects handling and cornering-can both be optimized, pushing the comfort level and the performance envelope at the same time. This is something todays pneumatic tire just cant do.\r<p><p>The possibilities of the Tweel seem endless. For instance, since the Tweel requires no air, holes or channels could be designed in the tread that could channel water literaly through the tread, thus improving aquaplaning resistance considerably. In the looks department, the Tweel is extremely low profile. At speed, the spokes seem to disappear, giving the appearance the vehicle is floating on air, while also revealing the brakes and associated suspension hardware. If that werent enough, to add a little "Bling Bling" the spokes of the Tweel could be chromed or painted to any desired color for that ultra custom look.\r<p><p>As for maintance, there is very little. There is no air to check, no more mounting and balancing, and no more flats.\r<p><p>Now before you run out to get yourself a set, you must understand that Michelin says they are ten years away from having the Tweel in mass production. That said, as you can see they already have a fitment available to at least bolt on an Audi, and with the benefits being so great, can it really be that far off?\r<p><p>Richard A.

At the Job One Celebration, Car and Driver editor-in-chief Csaba Csere presented the 10Best award to AAI President, Phil Spender. The new Mustang convertible received the Best Muscle Car accolade. \r<p><p>"To succeed today you need a car that''s hitting on all cylinders. It has to deliver style, quality, utility -- even if only a little bit -- as well as performance and value," said Csaba Csere, editor-in-chief of Car and Driver magazine. "Mustang does all of that, and that''s why we selected it to our 10Best list as Best Muscle Car for 2005."\r<p><p>Csere made this statement before Ford employees at the Auto Alliance International (AAI) in Flat Rock, Michigan – the Mustang''s new home. Csere also praised the new Mustang''s quality and reviewed its history dating back to April 17, 1964, when the first model went on sale. \r<p><p>"Back in the ''60s that car cut across demographic bounds," said Csere. "It was an affordable car, and everyone could buy a Mustang. But you saw a lot of Mustangs in the driveways of very rich people because the car was cool. The new Mustang has the potential for doing that as well. But it has to have a certain level of quality and refinement, and this car has achieved that. After touring the plant this morning I can see how that happened. This is a thoroughly modern facility that totally keeps track of the quality of the car."\r<p><p>Matt DeMars, vice president of Vehicle Operations, in accepting the award said that, "We''ve known for a long time we had a hit with the 2005 Mustang, and while customer excitement, and recognition like making Car and Driver''s ''10Best'' confirms what we always knew, it is still very gratifying,"\r<p><p>Compared to other coupe-derived vehicles, the 2005 Mustang Convertible has a more rigid body structure and is more solid. This was achieved by engineering it in tandem with the coupe. The result is the most quiet and solid drop top Mustang has ever produced, according to DeMars.\r<p><p>AAI President Phil Spender said the Mustang would begin shipping to dealers immediately. In addition to the new Mustang Convertible, AAI builds the Mustang Coupe and three body styles of Mazda6. Ford Motor Company invested $700 million in the plant last fall. It is now a flexible facility capable of building half-dozen vehicles on two platforms. AAI houses a new body shop with 380 robots and flexible tooling, as well as an upgraded stamping operation. Major upgrades to the final assembly area include programmable platforms that hold the car''s body on a scissor lift that can be adjusted to the operator''s height making it more ergonomic.\r<p><p>The 2005 Mustang Convertible is but another testament to Ford''s continuing legacy of excellence and innovation in the auto industry. As in all Ford models, a Mustang Convertible will experience automotive technology at its best. This experience is further enhanced by efficient maintenance and preservation. A great and secure way to maintain a vehicle is by installing only excellent quality parts purchased from reputable auto parts stores. In the past looking for a trusted parts supplier takes more tme and effort. \r<p><p>Fortunately, the internet makes shopping for parts a lot easier. There are dozens of sites that offer Ford parts.

If your agent is unable to solve your problem, get the name and phone number of your insurance companies Claims Department. It’s usually an 800 number. Call and ask if they have a Consumer Complaint Department? Most do. If so, talk to them because they may be able to help you. Don’t hang up until you get the specific name of the person with whom you spoke. (Make a note of the person you talked with and hold onto that until you’ve finished with your dispute).\r<p><p>#2.	Be ready to support your case by sending a covering letter (to that individual whom you spoke with) which contains all the documents you have to back up your position.\r<p><p>#3.	All insurance companies have either an “Appraisal Service” or “Arbitration Service” to help settle differences and/or disputes. Your policy should explain these options.(If you can’t find either of these ask your agent to find them for you)!\r<p><p>#4.	If you’ve followed their rules for resolving your dispute, and you’re still not satisfied, your own state’s insurance department should be able to help you.\r<p><p>#5.	If, after hearing from your own insurance company’s people (your confident that you’ve not been handled properly) you should call 1 800 942-4242 ( a toll-free Consumer Information Service) sponsored by the insurance industry. \r<p><p>Trained personnel are available to assist consumers who have complaints. THIS “HELP LINE” OPERATES ON EASTERN TIME, MONDAY THRU FRIDAY, 8:00 AM - 8:00 PM.	\r<p><p>#6.	ALSO: An “Independent Arbitrator”, who allegedly has experience in insurance problems, can decide if what you’ve been told (or offered to settle your claim) is fair. You can get to them by calling THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION 1 212 484-4000 or they can be contacted (via the internet) at .\r<p><p>#7.	MEDIATION: More often than not the Mediator does not have the authority to make a binding decision or issue an award to either party. The mediator only recommends a solution.\r<p><p>Mediation is a solid first step because it can negate the need for further expense on both sides. The first thing you should do is check the language in your auto insurance policy where it will spell out who will mediate (and/or arbitrate) a claim. You should submit a DEMAND FOR ARBITRATION FORM to whoever is listed in your policy. On that Demand for Arbitration Form you can specify whether you want “MEDIATION” or “ARBITRATION”.\r<p><p>DEMAND FOR ARBITRATION FORMS are available from your state’s Department Of Insurance, or you can print a copy of a Demand Form from the American Arbitration Association’s web site - - which can be found (as I’ve listed above in Number #6) at .	\r<p><p>AS YOU MOVE ALONG WITH THE ABOVE YOU MUST NEVER FORGET THESE TWO FOLLOWING (A & B = Below) CRUCIAL FACTS: \r<p><p>A.

Because of the excellent response and interest generated when the FJ Cruiser Concept was presented two years ago, Toyota decided to launch a production version of the SUV. The all-new production model retains much of the design details of the original concept. \r<p><p>Don Esmond, senior vice president and general manager, Toyota Division said "The FJ Cruiser effectively fills a gap in the Toyota lineup which was once our core heritage - capable, affordable and durable vehicles that are youthful, fun-to-drive, aggressive and tough," He also further clarified that "The FJ Cruiser will deliver true off-road ruggedness, image and performance at a very low price, making it highly accessible for a large volume of young buyers."\r<p><p>The FJ Cruiser''s final production design was a joint project by Toyota Motor Corporation and Calty Design Research. They developed the original concept vehicle shown at the North American International Auto Show of 2003. Inspired by the legendary off-road performance provided by the iconic FJ 40, the original 4Runner, and the 4x4 compact pickups, the FJ Cruiser is envisioned as a basic, capable and affordable off-roader aimed specifically at young buyers with active outdoor lifestyles.\r<p><p>The new FJ Cruiser has an authentic, functional form, yet adopts several styling elements with the original FJ 40. A number of these styling cues are visible upfront, such as the wide grill with "Toyota" logo badging, round headlights, and offset combination lamps. Other styling hints include the upright windshield and white cap roof. The rear also displays inspiration from the original FJ 40 with wrapping rear corner windows. The FJ Cruiser also has a modern shape that is woven into a compact package set on a wide track, producing enhanced stability and powerful stance. Utility features include a two-part rear hatch with flip-up glass, black overfenders with mudguards, and silver painted bumper extenders, mirrors, door handles and skid plate. Easy rear passenger entry into the two-door SUV is achieved with rear access doors.\r<p><p>Power is supplied by a 4.0-liter V6 engine, generating 245 horsepower and 282 lb-ft. of torque. The engine is paired with a five-speed automatic transmission on both 4x2 and 4x4 configurations and an available six-speed manual on 4x4 models. The five-passenger FJ Cruiser rides on a modified 4Runner platform and features 17-inch steel wheels and four-wheel disc brakes. Just like all of the SUV’s in Toyota''s line-up, the FJ Cruiser will be equipped with the Star Safety System which includes Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) and traction control (TRAC), an anti-lock brake system (ABS) with electronic brake-force distribution (EBD) and brake assist as standard. All 4x2 models will come with a standard automatic limited slip differential (ALSD).\r<p><p>The tough and straightforward theme of the FJ Cruiser is extended to the interior with a cabin designed specifically for basic functionality and flexible utility. The instrument panel features an exterior color trim, adding to its sophisticated, handcrafted appearance. The faceplate with round inset instrumentation communicates a mechanical appearance. The steering wheel and center-mounted shifter, and attached-look door panels feature tool-like simplicity. The rear seats fold flat, creating ample cargo space and maximum usability.\r<p><p>The interior will be equipped with an array of standard convenience features including air conditioning, AM/FM CD audio with six speakers, tilt steering wheel, four cupholders, passenger seat back pocket, and an upper dash-mounted map/glove box.\r<p><p>The new FJ Cruiser is Toyota''s response to today''s need for an efficient vehicle that is a product of Toyota''s renowned heritage of safety and refinement. With this new SUV, Toyota hopes to address the vehicle requirements of today''s active lifestyle. Another way to keep up with today''s dynamic lifestyle is to keep the FJ Cruiser or any Toyota vehicle in excellent condition. Maintaining such vehicles is easy using the best parts and accessories. Now, finding these parts and accessories is as easy as a few clicks.

(85, 'What is Satellite Radio?', '<b>What is Satellite Radio?</b><br><p>&nbsp;by: <b>Scott Fish</b><p><p>\r<p><p>Satellite Radio – Its here! Satellite radio is a new service being offered by two companies, XM Satellite Radio and Sirius Satellite Radio. Both companies are offering over 100 channels of streaming music and entertainment. High quality sound is achieved through the use of satellites orbiting high above. Satellite radio has been commercial free and free from regulations by federal committees. The impossible, is now possible, hearing the same radio station across north America and from coast to coast. All made possible by XM satellite radio and Sirius satellite radio.\r<p><p>XM Satellite Radio and Sirius Satellite Radio have designed satellite broadcast systems that differ but they achieve the same high quality of satellite radio. A milestone of this success is the fact that satellite radio signals that are available across the United States and into Mexico and Canada. Rock and Roll – No its not a genre any more! XM Satellite Radio has two satellites named Rock and Roll which remain in parallel geostationary orbit to provide radio coverage throughout the United States. Sirius Satellite Radio has chose to use three satellites in an inclined elliptical orbit. This configuration provides 16 hours per satellite of signal, which gives a great redundancy if any satellite were to fail. Playing it smart, Sirius and XM both have spare satellites, which can be called on in a moments notice if needed.\r<p><p>XM satellite radio and sirius satellite radio have Earth based broadcast stations that are used to send up information to the satellites, which is then dispersed through out the globe. Sirius and XM both have disk jockeys that manage, create and program music which is then sent up to the satellites. The information is then taken in by the satellites and sent through a rebroadcast of the streams to earth. The Major advantage of this is that, unlike earth-based radio stations whose signals reach listeners 150 miles away, satellite radio signals have a huge reach, and are receivable anywhere within the continental United States and hundreds of miles in each direction of the borders. Satellite Radio is growing to become a world wide network and offerings are growing throughout the world. XM satellite radio and Sirius satellite radio are making it happen! \r<p><p>So How Does Satellite Radio Work: First, a receiver decodes and plays the received signals through an antenna. In the beginning, some cars have used a tuner that accepts the antenna signals and then passes them to a satellite radio-ready radio for playing. Ad the concept has grown out of the car and into the home, home kits for satellite radio use direct RCA inputs for home theater and traditional stereo systems. A Growing number of choices is occurring and each company is developing a broad scope of products for consumers. Already we are seeing receivers for car-only, boom boxes, computer-only, and portables for use in car and home configurations. The companies making these products are, Audiovox, Delphi Skyfi, Terk, and plenty others are jumping on board. Both XM satellite radio and Sirius satellite radio have licensed recievers and other products for consumers use. \r<p><p><p><p><p><table width=100% cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 border=0 bgcolor=#dddddd><p><tr><td><p><p><b>About The Author</b><br><p>\r<p><p>Scott fish is the Owner of <a href="http://www.TopSatelliteRadio.com" target=new>www.TopSatelliteRadio.com</a>.\r<p><p>Top Satellite Radio is a resource for consumers seeking the history and facts about satellite radio.

More and more people—interest groups, government administrators, consumers and the industry are bothered by these. Since one cannot do away with transportation utilities, alternatives to the conventional gasoline engine are a current issue to both consumers and auto manufacturers. \r<p><p>The United States ranks as the world’s largest consumer of oil. Transportation is responsible for roughly 65 percent of petroleum use not to mention that it is likewise the major cause of air pollution. The Department of Energy sees the transitioning to vehicles which are fueled by less oil thereby yielding to higher gas mileage as the solution to the dependence on the already dwindling and too expensive resource that may lead to the reduction of pollution. \r<p><p>Hybrid cars are on the watch list. Several government leaders from all over America recommend the use of hybrid cars since they combine gas and electric fuel sources. Hybrid cars integrate a gasoline engine with both an electric motor and a powerful battery to continuously recharge and store energy therefore the configuration it produces allows less energy to be lost and holds a high gas mileage. \r<p><p>Practicality and technology speaks for the hybrids. Several manufacturers started coming up with their hybrid concepts to respond to the consumer and the present time’s call. Necessity is indeed the mother of invention, as Plato puts it. Ford is basically spurred by a sense of necessity, practicality, inevitability, and the reality that it is the ultimate relief to today’s downtrodden economy.\r<p><p>Ford Escape Hybrid is the very first vehicle to combine SUV capability with an outstanding fuel economy and low environmental impact. True to the qualities possessed by an SUV leader, Ford’s Escape Hybrid drives normally, performs superbly, and contains no compromise features expected of an efficient SUV. \r<p><p>"When we began work on Escape Hybrid, we made a commitment to delivering a no-compromise, authentic Ford SUV that''s fun to drive, spacious, comfortable and capable, with substantially lower fuel use and emissions," said Mary Ann Wright, director, Sustainable Mobility Technologies and Hybrid Programs, Ford Motor Company. "Mission accomplished! It''s wonderful to see the vehicle we originally envisioned resonating so strongly with customers," she added.\r<p><p>Escape Hybrid has earned the highest fuel economy numbers for an SUV as certified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency with its 36 mpg city/31 mpg highway/33 combined in front-wheel-drive configuration; 33 mpg city/29 mpg highway/31 mpg combined for the four-wheel-drive model. It is certifiably a clean vehicle to run and operate producing 97% less hydrocarbon and oxides of nitrogen emissions than vehicles that meet the nationwide Tier I emissions standard. No wonder Ford Escape Hybrid has been named "North American Truck of the Year" for 2005.\r<p><p>Ford owners need not worry of their Ford aftermarket parts for it’s just a click away.

It has been known as a work horse and its safety has always been very impressive and remarkable. With all the features and parts you can put in it, the Savana is very functional. Garnering  the highest rating in Federal Front Crash Test, the Savana continues to uphold its legacy of being a safe and durable van. These tests are conducted by the NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) to determine which vehicles are road worthy and safe.\r<p><p>General Motors Corporation is the world''s largest vehicle manufacturer; they employ 325,000 people globally in its core automotive business and subsidiaries. Founded in 1908, GM has been the global automotive sales leader since 1931. GM today has manufacturing operations in 32 countries and its vehicles are sold in more than 190 countries. GM''s global headquarters is at the GM Renaissance Center in Detroit.\r<p><p>"The GMC Savana was designed and built with safety as a priority," said Ray Chess, vehicle line executive for full-size vans. "The Savana is equipped with segment-leading features that enhance both safety and security for our customers." \r<p><p>The rating is part of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration''s New Car Assessment Program (NCAP). In this frontal impact test, vehicles are crashed into a fixed barrier at 35 miles per hour, equivalent to a head-on collision between two similar vehicles each moving at 35 mph. A five-star rating ranks the likelihood of serious injury in a 35-mph frontal crash at 10 percent or less. For this NCAP test, NHTSA crashed a 1500 Series (1/2-ton), 8-passenger, two-wheel-drive GMC Savana.\r<p><p>Initially introduced in 1965, GMC''s full-size van has since undergone only one complete redesign. Constant improvements throughout the ''70s, ''80s and ''90s kept it somewhat up to date, but not until a full redesign in 1995 did the Savana become a legitimately modern vehicle. A new exterior look, new engines, extended body styles and improved ergonomics made the previous Savana hard to overlook when compared with the aging Econoline from Ford. The latest version incorporates some significant improvements like electronic stability control and powerful V8 engines that make the Savana safer and more capable than ever before. The Savana delivers a host of safety features, including trade-leading safety firsts such as standard electronic stability on all one-ton passenger vans, available all-wheel drive; and the available OnStar safety and security system on passenger and conversion models. The extended version Express and the Savana vans also feature the longest wheelbases in the !\r<p><p>business, which further enhance stability. \r<p><p>The 2005 GMC Savana vans offer a choice of three power plants and all-wheel drive. The standard engine on two-wheel-drive half-ton models is a 4.3-liter V6 rated at 195 horsepower and 260 pound-feet of torque. A 5.3-liter V8 with 295 hp and 325 lb-ft of torque is standard on all-wheel-drive half-tons and optional on two-wheel-drive versions. Three-quarter- and one-ton models come standard with a 6.0-liter V8 rated at 300 hp and 360 lb-ft of torque.\r<p><p>The 2005 Savana provides the room you need with the comfort you want. Whether you''re looking for a passenger or a conversion van, Savana is equipped with an optional driver-side 60/40 swing out door, available all-wheel drive and seating for up to 15 people. Savana is engineered to offer you extraordinary versatility helping to keep you safe and getting you there comfortably. At work or play, Savana is professional grade.\r<p><p>If you’re looking for a van that has a powerful engine, some fantastically unique features and doesn’t look like it has been designed two decades ago, then the 2005 GMC Savana is for you. Not only is it strong, beautiful and full of use, it is also very safe. It is built to guarantee safety. But anyway, no matter how durable a car is, it is still susceptible to wear and tear through constant use. This are facts of life (a car’s life actually) that cannot be denied.

Nissan Exchange is a new program designed to give Nissan owners the performance from brand new parts with the service tag of used ones. Nissan Exchange caters to two auto body parts exchange, the Nissan Engine Exchange and the Nissan Gearbox exchange. The concept of “exchanging”, meaning to trade an old part---say an engine, to be refurbished and brought back to life as a brand new product using genuine parts, has been around for decades. But Nissan takes it a step further by assuring prospective Nissan Exchange customers that only genuine Nissan parts will be used by professionally trained Nissan technicians and mechanics.\r<p><p>The Nissan Engine Exchange service remanufactures the engine according to the manufacturer’s specifications. This is done by subjecting the engine to a multi-level process of dismantling, cleaning, machining, identification and replacement of faulty parts, reconditioning and assembly. Each engine is stripped to expose its basic components and critical items such as pistons, bearings, thermostats and timing chains which will be manually inspected and replaced with new Nissan Approved Parts. With this extensive process, you can be assured of superior quality engine at par with brand new Nissan engine blocks. Only genuine, high quality Nissan approved parts are used in the Nissan Engine Exchange. \r<p><p>Following on the success of the elder Nissan Engine Exchange program, the Nissan Gearbox Exchange is also ready to service Nissan car owners. The same meticulous process is followed where every gearbox brought in is stripped down to its bare elements. Every gear box component from seals to bearings and gaskets are individually inspected by trained technicians who painstakingly scrutinize each piece and work to reassemble each part after meeting the manufacturer’s standard specs. With the Nissan Gearbox Exchange, every gearbox carries a 12-month warranty which is the same as the warranty for the brand new unit—a committed assurance to clients of quality service and products.\r<p><p>These programs rely on great Nissan parts to ensure its smooth sail.

This announcement is based on Autodata Corp.''s October 2004 data for single-line make certified used vehicle sales. With record monthly sales of 40,666 units in October of last year, Chevrolet overtook Toyota to become America''s best selling certified used vehicle manufacturer. This is according to Jeff Heichel, the director of GM Used Vehicle Activities. \r<p><p>According to the Autodata U.S. Certified Pre-Owned Vehicle Retail Sales - October 2004 summary report, GM Certified Used Vehicles - which includes Chevrolet, Pontiac, Buick, GMC and Oldsmobile models - has sold 218,451 Chevrolet certified units through October 2004, exceeding by 26,240 the 192,211 certified units sold during the same period by Toyota, the previous category leader in single-line make certified used vehicle sales\r<p><p>A certified used vehicle is becoming a popular alternative to higher priced brand new cars.

More importantly, by choosing a certified used vehicle the buyer is assured that the major drawbacks that people encounter in used cars, namely:  uncertainty about the mechanical condition of the vehicle, is ruled out. This is because certified used vehicles have already been thoroughly inspected by a mechanic. Anything that was wrong, or about to go wrong, has been repaired.\r<p><p>"Chevrolet''s position as the top-selling single-line make certified used vehicle brand is a strong testament to the excellent value offered by Chevrolet cars and trucks and the active engagement of the GM Certified dealer network," said Heichel.

(93, 'New Car Launches in India in 2005', '<b>New Car Launches in India in 2005</b><br><p>&nbsp;by: <b>Babychen Mathew</b><p><p>\r<p><p>The Indian car industry has gathered steam only in the last decade. Just imagine - 15 years back, there were only two cars being manufactured in India, the vintage Hindustan Ambassador and the venerable Premier Padmini. The Ambassador was the Indian version of the Morris Oxford, while the Padmini was based on an ancient Fiat model. Compare that to today, when every major automobile manufacturer has its cars on the road in India. 2005 is the year when India is poised to see more automobile launches that before. Let''s take a look at the vehicles that are expected.\r<p><p>Toyota Innova\r<p><p>Toyota has three vehicles in the Indian market - the Toyota Qualis, Camry and Corolla. The Qualis is the most outdated of the lot, with the looks of a breadbox. However, this model was extremely succesful in India due to its reliability and was used by many taxi operators in the country. Toyota has just withdrawn the vehicle from the market, and is about to introduce the Innova, a much more modern MPV in the minivan mould that can hold its own amongst the latest international vehicles. The pricing is expected to be around that of the now-extinct Qualis, making it approachable for the Indian middle-class.\r<p><p>Skoda Fabia\r<p><p>Skoda will be launching its small car Fabia in India by mid-2005. While the ocompany has yet not decided on whether the model in India should be a sedan, hatchback or estate, this car is bound to have a following. This is partly due to the tremendous reputation Skoda enjoys in India due to its highly succesful Octavia range. The power unit too is still undecided, but what we believe is that it will be priced at the same level as Honda''s highly succesful small car, the Honda City.\r<p><p>Chevrolet Aveo\r<p><p>Maruti Suzuki Swift\r<p><p>Maruti is India''s most succesful automobile company, and Suzuki recently acquired a controlling stake in it. The Swift will be Maruti''s first radical, contemporary vehicle. The company has always preferred to play it safe, and has introduced tried-and-tested vehicle models from the Suzuki stable. The Swift is based on Suzuki''s famous Concept S design unveiled at teh 2002 Paris Auto Show, and will be launched in India with the reliable Maruti Esteem''s (an older Suzuki Swift version) 1300 cc petrol engine in India.\r<p><p>Toyota Fortuner\r<p><p>The Fortuner will be launched in the later half 2005 in India. It is a small-SUV which should give a run to the Honda CR-V which rules th SUV market in India now. The Fortuner is based on the same platform as the Innova.

The quality of your estimate depends on getting a good range. It''s a good idea to check the prices over several weeks if you can.\r<p>	<p><li>Online Valuation services may have inaccuracies for particular models and should not be relied on exclusively, just because they seem to be the authorities. Their valuation is only as good as the data they have to go on. Since a large number of transactions bypass their data collection you can only consider it an estimate. It could be out by as much as $1000 easily.\r<p>	<p><li>Seasonal demands influence the prices of cars. Convertibles sell for higher prices in the summer time. These swings can exceed the ranges given in valuations.\r<p></ol>\r<p><p>There is one more factor that overides all the above. The final price you get is not it''s worth. It''s worth is it''s value. A good, reliable car with no rust, that has been maintained can be sold for more money. It is worth more than a newer car that has been poorly maintained.

It is the most available and cost-effective de-icer.  It is easy to store, handle, and apply. \r<p><p>Some 15 million tons of de-icing salt is used each year in the U.S. and about 4-5 million in Canada. \r<p><p>Salt keeps snow and ice from bonding to the pavement and to allow snowplows to remove accumulations quickly and efficiently. \r<p><p>Studies show that salt use reduces accidents by 88%. \r<p><p>Washing your car during wintertime is one of the best things you can do to maintain the value of your car.  Mud, salt, rain, sleet, and snow can damage your car''s clear finish. Mud and salt caked on the undercarriage promote rust, especially in older vehicles, and can also affect how well your car drives. \r<p><p>To prevent winter damage, it is recommended that you wash your vehicle every 10 days. Wash your vehicle whenever the temperature is 40 degrees F. and above.  Do it during the day so that it dries completely before freezing evening temperatures begin. \r<p><p>Immediately after washing the vehicle, open and close all doors, the trunk, and other parts of the car with locks several times before parking it to prevent locks from freezing. \r<p><p>Always wash your car right after a snow or rain shower. Rain and snow collect pollutants in the air and drop them as acid rain which can damage the cars protective finish.  Snow and sleet also include the corrosive road salt. \r<p><p>Wash the underside of your car often during the winter months in car washes that do not use recycled water. \r<p><p>Avoid driving through large puddles of standing water which is saturated with road salt. \r<p><p>Any paint chips that are larger than the tip of a pen should be taken care of immediately. \r<p><p>Wax your car at least every six months.  Put a good heavy coat of wax on your car before the winter storms hit. This heavy coat will protect your paint from the corrosive salt and cold temperatures. \r<p><p>More frequent waxes are needed if your car is red, black or white because these colors are more susceptible to acid rain and UV rays. \r<p><p>When spring time rolls around, treat your car to a good wax job again. Be sure to remove all road grime and salt off of the car before you begin waxing. \r<p><p>For more information:\r<p><br><a href="http://www.apluswriting.net/gasmiles/5starshine.html" target=new>http://www.apluswriting.net/gasmiles/5starshine.html</a>\r<p>\r<p><p>REQUIREMENTS FOR REPRINT: \r<p><p>You have permission to publish this article free of charge in your e-zine, newsletter, ebook, print publication or on your website ONLY if it remains unchanged and you include the copyright and author information (Resource Box) at the end.

Sometimes I buy OEM, others aftermarket motorcycle parts. \r<p><p>Keep reading. You will find some views that will hopefully help you decide the next time you shop for motorcycle parts.\r<p><p>What a heck are OEM parts??\r<p><p>OEM parts stands for Original Equipment Manufacturer parts which not necessarily mean the OM (Original Manufacturer) actually produced them. You know, many motorcycle and automobile manufacturers don''t manufacture each of the parts used in their vehicles. They frequently have the parts designed and manufactured by outside independent companies and then, install them in their machines or put them in their own boxes to be sold as OEM parts!\r<p><p>Good to know when buying OEM Motorcycle Parts:\r<p><p>When you buy OEM Motorcycle Parts you are buying the exact same original part the manufacturer used to build your motorcycle, that means:\r<p><ul>\r<p>	<p><li>Same performance as the part installed in your motorcycle right now. The part won''t be better nor worse than the original part you want to replace.\r<p>	<p><li>Normally OEM parts a more (in some cases MUCH more) expensive than aftermarket parts.\r<p>	<p><li>Motorcycle and car agencies clerks will normally tell you OEM Parts are higher quality and the best option for replacements. Is this true? Well sometimes it is, sometimes it''s not.\r<p>	<p><li>Normally after a certain period of time, the manufacturer will allow the company that originally designed/produced the part to sell it in their own box at a considerably lower cost, making it: an Aftermarket OEM part!  :-) \r<p>	<p><li>BE CAREFUL if your bike is still in its guarantee period make sure you use only OEM parts and have them installed by authorized mechanics. If you don''t do so, you will probably void the guarantee.\r<p></ul>\r<p><p>What about Aftermarket parts??\r<p><p>Aftermarket parts should perform as well as OEM parts but are produced by companies other than the original manufacturer(s).\r<p><p>Things to know when buying Aftermarket Motorcycle Parts:\r<p><ul>\r<p>	<p><li>MAKE SURE YOUR GUARANTEE PERIOD IS OVER. In many cases, you can VOID your guarantee if you have an aftermarket part installed by an unauthorized mechanic in your machine. I know I said it before, but it''s worth repeating; I happened to me!  :-( \r<p>	<p><li>Equivalent aftermarket Suzuki motorcycle parts are normally cheaper than OEM parts. Sometimes up to 70% cheaper!\r<p>	<p><li>Aftermarket parts can have lower,the same or higher quality than the original.\r<p>	<p><li>When buying aftermarket parts make sure you are getting AT LEAST the same quality as the OEM part. If possible try to get some reviews about brands and performance. You can do it in the Internet, with your favorite mechanic or with fellow riders.\r<p>	<p><li>If you are looking for high performance parts and devices, you know the kind: carbon fiber, titanium, aerospace aluminum parts and gizmos, well you will probably find them as aftermarket motorcycle parts.\r<p></ul>\r<p><p>OEM or aftermarket motorcycle parts, sooner or later you will be shopping for them...\r<p><p>Enjoy the ride!\r<p><p>Daniel Levy\r<p><p><p><p><p><table width=100% cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 border=0 bgcolor=#dddddd><p><tr><td><p><p><b>About The Author</b><br><p>\r<p><p>Daniel Levy is the owner and contributing writer of <a href="http://www.Japanese-Motorcycles-Only.com" target=new>www.Japanese-Motorcycles-Only.com</a>.

To collect money for this civil wrong there must be damages or injury; without one or both, there can be no recovery of money.\r<p><p>If you have a claim that has a complicated set of circumstances or evidence, one which obviously demands legal advice, than you need a lawyer.\r<p><p>If you hired Attorney I. M. Sharp and he had to burn the midnight oil for you and/or even win your case, there can be no objection to his collecting his fee. But, far too often, in cases of a completely uncontestable claim, one finds themselves handing over a huge percentage of that recover to a lawyer for doing minus-zip!\r<p><p>I’m referring to the average motor vehicle accident case, one where it’s absolutely clear that the other individual, “Fumbling” Fred Fuddle, is clearly at fault. Attorney Sharp sends out his routine Letter Of Representation to Fuddle‘s carrier THE GRANITE MOUNTAIN INSURANCE CORPORATION, secures the Medical Bills and Reports from your “Ole” Doc’ Comfort, and procures a Police Report, if one is available. Then, for less than two dollars worth of stamps and an hour spent on negotiations Sharp (depending upon where you live) extracts a fee of between 331/3/% to 50% in settlement.\r<p><p>For example, say Attorney Sharp settles a case for $3,000, and then takes a fee of 1/3 of that $3000. It doesn’t take a degree in mathematics to figure out that you’re paying him $1,000 for what is usually  - - less than a few hours work.\r<p><p>After you’ve paid Attorney Sharp’s fee, along with your medical bills to Doc Comfort, and after deducting the money recovered from the time lost from work out of that $3000 settlement, the bottom-line monetary compensation to you has been plundered !\r<p><p>IN THEORY, the money you have left, after deducting these expenses, is your Financial Reward for the “Pain and Suffering” you‘ve been forced to endure. But with the naive signing on with a lawyer (to settle a claim that’s clearly not your fault) you’re left with a feeling of decimation because you’ve definitely not been left with what you deserved for the physical and emotional ordeal you’ve been forced to deal with. \r<p><p>When Attorney Sharp settles your claim he doesn’t deduct your out-of-pocket expenses before he takes his fee. Instead, he takes his fee “Right Off The Top” where the cream floats. Then, with what’s left, your out-of-pocket expenses are paid.\r<p><p>FOR EXAMPLE: The damage to your Motor Vehicle is $1,500, your Medical Bills are $400, and your Lost Wages are $600, for a total of $2,500. Even in a case of Clear Liability, the lawyer not only takes a one-third cut from the “Pain and Suffering” portion of the settlement, he also takes a third of your out-of-pocket expenses ! \r<p><p>Now, think it out: Your Property Damage was $1,500, Your Medical Bills $400 and your Lost Wages $600 came to a total of $2,500. Then you’re paid $3000 for your “Pain and Suffering” so the total settlement is $5,500.\r<p><p>In a perfect world, in a case of clear liability, Attorney Sharp’s fee should have been taken from the $3000 you were paid for your “Pain and Suffering”. If he did, his fee would have been 1/3 of $3000 or $1,000. But, without fail, Sharp will take his 1/3 of the grand total of $5,500, bringing his fee to $1,833.33. That’s outrageously unfair because, in a case of clear liability, GRANITE MOUNTAIN would have paid you your out-of-pocket expenses of $2,500, - - whether you had a lawyer representing you or not !\r<p><p>ALWAYS REMEMBER: When you handle your own case (should you and GRANITE MOUNTAIN later disagree as to the value of your claim) there’s a Time Limit established at which you can break off your negotiations and then proceed to obtain the services of Attorney Sharp. This time limit is called a “STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS“ it’s never less than a year and in most cases it’s two or three; some states provide you with this kind of protection for as long as five or six years. To be sure you must check out how much time you have to fuss with Fuddle’s insurance company before you hand your case to a lawyer to handle for you.\r<p><p>Dan Baldyga’s third and latest book AUTO ACCIDENT PERSONAL INJURY INSURANCE CLAIM (How To Evaluate And Settle Your Loss) can be found on the internet at <a href="http://www.caraccidentclaims.com" target=new>http://www.caraccidentclaims.com</a> or <a href="http://www.autoaccidentclaims.com" target=new>http://www.autoaccidentclaims.com</a>.

Since its earlier days, innovations on automobile technology have been continuous. Engineers and manufacturers have sought to give the public improved performance, more comfortable features and safer cars. And this goal continues up to now and the process has even become more meticulous as car buyers have started to become more specific about what they want from their cars.\r<p><p>In this high-tech, computer-driven world car makers are striving to produce the best technologies to make their cars safer and more enjoyable to drive. Mercedes leads the pack in engineering technology as it has managed to feature in its vehicles some of the most precise, up-to-date and excellent quality car parts, accessories, safety features and entertainment systems. But not to be outdone, Mercedes still continues on its quest to give its patrons nothing but the best. Below is a list of the up and coming state of the art features engineered by Mercedes.\r<p><p>Latest Mercedes technology that will be used in its future cars:\r<p><p>1) Safety systems with radar and cameras that watch out for danger as you drive. These safety equipment will be able to warn you of imminent danger by using advance mathematics to calculate the possibilities and the chances of danger occurring. This will be the future’s way of fortune telling!\r<p><p>2) Keyless entry is already being used on other vehicles like the Cadillac, Infinity and BMW models, Mercedes on the other hand is on its way to using a credit card style system which will replace car keys in the near tomorrow. That will make for lighter pockets! \r<p><p>3) Highly improved navigation console systems that includes computer-like screens on the dash, global positioning satellite and on board DVD’s which can easily flash directions, maps, vital information on businesses like hotels, hospitals etc will be installed in every Mercedes. Getting lost will be a lot harder with these in your car!\r<p><p>4) Wi-Fi hook-ups in almost every vehicle will provide weather, news, and other information. Long trips won’t be the same with these kinds of entertainment on board!\r<p><p>5) Various parts of the vehicle will be connected to a computer program which will be able to store relevant data to aid dealers, manufacturers and your mechanic in diagnosing the problem. With a handy cellular phone or laptop, you can transfer the data to the Internet and get a long-distance troubleshoot for your Mercedes. New technologies such as these, nothing IS impossible!\r<p><p>6) 40 Volt Electrical Systems will be a standard feature on the Mercedes which will allow for more electrical equipments to be brought into the vehicle. \r<p><p>7) Voice prompts allows you to “talk” to your car and command it to operate various basic functions such as locating a radios station. This technology is already used in certain BMW’s, Jaguar, Lexus and Mercedes models and will continue to be used and adapted as standard features on all trims and models. \r<p><p>8) Electronically controlled pedals, already used by Mercedes, will be installed in more of its vehicles. It sends an electronic signal rather than set the brake or accelerator in motion through physical contact which allows a split-second action. \r<p><p>9) Programmable Mercedes vehicles will arrive in the foreseeable future. It allows the driver to choose the type of vehicle to drive and uses electronics to adjust his Mercedes according to his personal preference like lowering or raising ground clearance for varied ground effects. The choice between sporty and luxurious, stylish and chic has never been easier!\r<p><p>With these technological breakthroughs, you need an auto parts store that updates its stocks along with the non-stop evolution of the vehicles in the market.
